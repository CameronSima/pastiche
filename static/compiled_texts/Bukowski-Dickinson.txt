        at the track today,

        one flies
        off.
        then

        still.
        and I am
        reduced to bird
        watching.
        just thought I'd
        let you
        know,
        fucker.
        





        A Challenge To The Dark
        shot in the eye
        shot in the brain
        shot in the ass
        shot like a flower in the dance
        





        A Following
        the phone rang at 1:30 a.m.
        and it was a man from Denver:
        





        A Man


        





        A Radio With Guts
        it was on the 2nd floor on Coronado Street
        I used to get drunk
        and throw the radio through the window
        while it was playing, and, of course,
        it would break the glass in the window
        and the radio would sit there on the roof
        still playing
        and I'd tell my woman,
        &quot;Ah, what a marvelous radio!&quot;
        the next morning I'd take the window
        off the hinges
        and carry it down the street
        to the glass man
        who would put in another pane.
        I kept throwing that radio through the window
        each time I got drunk
        and it would sit there on the roof
        still playing-
        a magic radio
        a radio with guts,
        and each morning I'd take the window
        back to the glass man.
        I don't remember how it ended exactly
        though I do remember
        we finally moved out.
        there was a woman downstairs who worked in
        the garden in her bathing suit,
        she really dug with that trowel
        and she put her behind up in the air
        and I used to sit in the window
        and watch the sun shine all over that thing
        while the music played.
        





        a smile to remember
        we had goldfish and they circled around and around
        in the bowl on the table near the heavy drapes
        covering the picture window and
        my mother, always smiling, wanting us all
        to be happy, told me, "be happy Henry!"
        and she was right: it's better to be happy if you
        can
        but my father continued to beat her and me several times a week while
        raging inside his 6-foot-two frame because he couldn't
        understand what was attacking him from within.
        my mother, poor fish,
        wanting to be happy, beaten two or three times a
        week, telling me to be happy: "Henry, smile!
        why don't you ever smile?"
        and then she would smile, to show me how, and it was the
        saddest smile I ever saw
        one day the goldfish died, all five of them,
        they floated on the water, on their sides, their
        eyes still open,
        and when my father got home he threw them to the cat
        there on the kitchen floor and we watched as my mother
        smiled
        





        Alone With Everybody
        the flesh covers the bone
        and they put a mind
        in there and
        sometimes a soul,
        and the women break
        vases against the walls
        and the men drink too
        much
        and nobody finds the
        one
        but keep
        looking
        crawling in and out
        of beds.
        flesh covers
        the bone and the
        flesh searches
        for more than
        flesh.
        there's no chance
        at all:
        we are all trapped
        by a singular
        fate.
        nobody ever finds
        the one.
        the city dumps fill
        the junkyards fill
        the madhouses fill
        the hospitals fill
        the graveyards fill
        nothing else
        fills.

        An Almost Made Up Poem
        I see you drinking at a fountain with tiny
        blue hands, no, your hands are not tiny
        they are small, and the fountain is in France
        where you wrote me that last letter and
        I answered and never heard from you again.
        you used to write insane poems about
        ANGELS AND GOD, all in upper case, and you
        knew famous artists and most of them
        were your lovers, and I wrote back, it&#146; all right,
        go ahead, enter their lives, I&#146; not jealous
        because we&#146; never met. we got close once in
        New Orleans, one half block, but never met, never
        touched. so you went with the famous and wrote
        about the famous, and, of course, what you found out
        is that the famous are worried about
        their fame &#150;&#150; not the beautiful young girl in bed
        with them, who gives them that, and then awakens
        in the morning to write upper case poems about
        ANGELS AND GOD. we know God is dead, they&#146; told
        us, but listening to you I wasn&#146; sure. maybe
        it was the upper case. you were one of the
        best female poets and I told the publishers,
        editors, &#147; her, print her, she&#146; mad but she&#146;
        magic. there&#146; no lie in her fire.&#148; I loved you
        like a man loves a woman he never touches, only
        writes to, keeps little photographs of. I would have
        loved you more if I had sat in a small room rolling a
        cigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom,
        but that didn&#146; happen. your letters got sadder.
        your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, all
        lovers betray. it didn&#146; help. you said
        you had a crying bench and it was by a bridge and
        the bridge was over a river and you sat on the crying
        bench every night and wept for the lovers who had
        hurt and forgotten you. I wrote back but never
        heard again. a friend wrote me of your suicide
        3 or 4 months after it happened. if I had met you
        I would probably have been unfair to you or you
        to me. it was best like this.
        





        And The Moon And The Stars And The World
        Long walks at night--
        that's what good for the soul:
        peeking into windows
        watching tired housewives
        trying to fight off
        their beer-maddened husbands.
        





        Another Day
        having the low down blues and going
        into a restraunt to eat.
        you sit at a table.
        the waitress smiles at you.
        she's dumpy. her ass is too big.
        she radiates kindess and symphaty.
        live with her 3 months and a man would no real agony.
        o.k., you'll tip her 15 percent.
        you order a turkey sandwich and a
        beer.
        the man at the table across from you
        has watery blue eyes and
        a head like an elephant.
        at a table further down are 3 men
        with very tiny heads
        and long necks
        like ostiches.
        they talk loudly of land development.
        why, you think, did I ever come
        in here when I have the low-down
        blues?
        then the the waitress comes back eith the sandwich
        and she asks you if there will be anything
        else?
        snd you tell her, no no, this will be
        fine.
        then somebody behind you laughs.
        it's a cork laugh filled with sand and
        broken glass.
        you begin eating the sandwhich.
        it's something.
        it's a minor, difficult,
        sensible action
        like composing a popular song
        to make a 14-year old
        weep.
        you order another beer.
        jesus,look at that guy
        his hands hang down almost to his knees and he's
        whistling.
        well, time to get out.
        pivk up the bill.
        tip.
        go to the register.
        pay.
        pick up a toothpick.
        go out the door.
        your car is still there.
        and there are 3 men with heads
        and necks

        like ostriches all getting into one
        car.
        they each have a toothpick and now
        they are talking about women.
        they drive away first
        they drive away fast.
        they're best i guess.
        it's an unberably hot day.
        there's a first-stage smog alert.
        all the birds and plants are dead
        or dying.
        you start the engine.

        Are You Drinking?
        washed-up, on shore, the old yellow notebook
        out again
        I write from the bed
        as I did last
        year.
        will see the doctor,
        Monday.
        &quot;yes, doctor, weak legs, vertigo, head-
        aches and my back
        hurts.&quot;
        &quot;are you drinking?&quot; he will ask.
        &quot;are you getting your
        exercise, your
        vitamins?&quot;
        I think that I am just ill
        with life, the same stale yet
        fluctuating
        factors.
        even at the track
        I watch the horses run by
        and it seems
        meaningless.
        I leave early after buying tickets on the
        remaining races.
        &quot;taking off?&quot; asks the motel
        clerk.
        &quot;yes, it's boring,&quot;
        I tell him.
        &quot;If you think it's boring
        out there,&quot; he tells me, &quot;you oughta be
        back here.&quot;
        so here I am
        propped up against my pillows
        again
        just an old guy
        just an old writer
        with a yellow
        notebook.
        something is
        walking across the
        floor
        toward
        me.
        oh, it's just
        my cat
        this
        time.
        




        As The Poems Go
        as the poems go into the thousands you
        realize that you've created very
        little.
        





        As The Sparrow
        To give life you must take life,
        and as our grief falls flat and hollow
        upon the billion-blooded sea
        I pass upon serious inward-breaking shoals rimmed
        with white-legged, white-bellied rotting creatures
        lengthily dead and rioting against surrounding scenes.
        Dear child, I only did to you what the sparrow
        did to you; I am old when it is fashionable to be
        young; I cry when it is fashionable to laugh.
        I hated you when it would have taken less courage
        to love.
        





        back to the machine gun
        I awaken about noon and go out to get the mail
        in my old torn bathrobe.
        I'm hung over
        hair down in my eyes
        barefoot
        gingerly walking on the small sharp rocks
        in my path
        still afraid of pain behind my four-day beard.
        the young housewife next door shakes a rug
        out of her window and sees me:
        "hello, Hank!"
        god damn! it's almost like being shot in the ass
        with a .22
        "hello," I say
        gathering up my Visa card bill, my Pennysaver coupons,
        a Dept. of Water and Power past-due notice,
        a letter from the mortgage people
        plus a demand from the Weed Abatement Department
        giving me 30 days to clean up my act.
        I mince back again over the small sharp rocks
        thinking, maybe I'd better write something tonight,
        they all seem
        to be closing in.
        there's only one way to handle those motherfuckers.
        the night harness races will have to wait.

        Big Night On The Town
        drunk on the dark streets of some city,
        it's night, you're lost, where's your
        room?
        you enter a bar to find yourself,
        order scotch and water.
        damned bar's sloppy wet, it soaks
        part of one of your shirt
        sleeves.
        It's a clip joint-the scotch is weak.
        you order a bottle of beer.
        Madame Death walks up to you
        wearing a dress.
        she sits down, you buy her a
        beer, she stinks of swamps, presses
        a leg against you.
        the bar tender sneers.
        you've got him worried, he doesn't
        know if you're a cop, a killer, a
        madman or an
        Idiot.
        you ask for a vodka.
        you pour the vodka into the top of
        the beer bottle.
        It's one a.m. In a dead cow world.
        you ask her how much for head,
        drink everything down, it tastes
        like machine oil.
        you leave Madame Death there,
        you leave the sneering bartender
        there.
        you have remembered where
        your room is.
        the room with the full bottle of
        wine on the dresser.
        the room with the dance of the
        roaches.
        Perfection in the Star Turd
        where love died
        laughing.
        





        Bluebird
        there's a bluebird in my heart that
        wants to get out
        but I'm too tough for him,
        I say, stay in there, I'm not going
        to let anybody see
        you.
        





        Carson McCullers
        she died of alcoholism
        wrapped in a blanket
        on a deck chair
        on an ocean
        steamer.
        all her books of
        terrified loneliness
        all her books about
        the cruelty
        of loveless love
        were all that was left
        of her
        as the strolling vacationer
        discovered her body
        notified the captain
        and she was quickly dispatched
        to somewhere else
        on the ship
        as everything
        continued just
        as
        she had written it
        





        Cause And Effect
        the best often die by their own hand
        just to get away,
        and those left behind
        can never quite understand
        why anybody
        would ever want to
        get away
        from
        them
        





        close to greatness
        at one stage in my life
        I met a man who claimed to have
        visited Pound at St. Elizabeths.
        then I met a woman who not only
        claimed to have visited
        E.P.
        but also to have made love
        to him--she even showed
        me
        certain sections in the
        Cantos
        where Ezra was supposed to have
        mentioned
        her.
        so there was this man and
        this woman
        and the woman told me
        that Pound had never
        mentioned a visit from this
        man
        and the man claimed that the
        lady had had nothing to do
        with the
        master
        that she was a
        charlatan
        and since I wasn't a
        Poundian scholar
        I didn't know who to
        believe
        but one thing I do
        know: when a man is
        living
        many claim relationships
        that are hardly
        so
        and after he dies, well,
        then it's everybody's
        party.
        my guess is that Pound
        knew neither the lady or the
        gentleman
        or if he knew
        one
        or if he knew
        both


        it was a shameful waste of
        madhouse
        time.
        





        Confession
        waiting for death
        like a cat
        that will jump on the
        bed
        I am so very sorry for
        my wife
        she will see this
        stiff
        white
        body
        shake it once, then
        maybe
        again
        "Hank!"
        Hank won't
        answer.
        it's not my death that
        worries me, it's my wife
        left with this
        pile of
        nothing.
        I want to
        let her know
        though
        that all the nights
        sleeping
        beside her
        even the useless
        arguments
        were things
        ever splendid
        and the hard
        words
        I ever feared to
        say
        can now be
        said:
        I love
        you.
        



        Consummation Of Grief
        I even hear the mountains
        the way they laugh
        up and down their blue sides
        and down in the water
        the fish cry
        and the water
        is their tears.
        I listen to the water
        on nights I drink away
        and the sadness becomes so great
        I hear it in my clock
        it becomes knobs upon my dresser
        it becomes paper on the floor
        it becomes a shoehorn
        a laundry ticket
        it becomes
        cigarette smoke
        climbing a chapel of dark vines. . .
        it matters little
        very little love is not so bad
        or very little life
        what counts
        is waiting on walls
        I was born for this
        I was born to hustle roses down the avenues of the dead.

        good weather
        is like
        good women-
        it doesn't always happen
        and when it does
        it doesn't
        always last.
        man is
        more stable:
        if he's bad
        there's more chance
        he'll stay that way,
        or if he's good
        he might hang
        on,
        but a woman
        is changed
        by
        children
        age
        diet
        conversation
        sex
        the moon
        the absence or
        presence of sun
        or good times.
        a woman must be nursed
        into subsistence
        by love
        where a man can become
        stronger
        by being hated.
        





        Curtain
        the final curtain on one of the longest running
        musicals ever, some people claim to have
        seen it over one hundred times.
        I saw it on the tv news, that final curtain:
        flowers, cheers, tears, a thunderous
        accolade.
        I have not seen this particular musical
        but I know if I had that I wouldn't have
        been able to bear it, it would have
        sickened me.
        trust me on this, the world and its
        peoples and its artful entertainment has
        done very little for me, only to me.
        still, let them enjoy one another, it will
        keep them from my door
        and for this, my own thunderous
        accolade.
        





        Cut While Shaving
        It's never quite right, he said, the way people look,
        the way the music sounds, the way the words are
        written.
        It's never quite right, he said, all the things we are
        taught, all the loves we chase, all the deaths we
        die, all the lives we live,
        they are never quite right,
        they are hardly close to right,
        these lives we live
        one after the other,
        piled there as history,
        the waste of the species,
        the crushing of the light and the way,
        it's not quite right,
        it's hardly right at all
        he said.
        don't I know it? I
        answered.
        I walked away from the mirror.
        it was morning, it was afternoon, it was
        night
        nothing changed
        it was locked in place.
        something flashed, something broke, something
        remained.
        I walked down the stairway and
        into it.

        Death Wants More Death
        death wants more death, and its webs are full:
        I remember my father's garage, how child-like
        I would brush the corpses of flies
        from the windows they thought were escape-
        their sticky, ugly, vibrant bodies
        shouting like dumb crazy dogs against the glass
        only to spin and flit
        in that second larger than hell or heaven
        onto the edge of the ledge,
        and then the spider from his dank hole
        nervous and exposed
        the puff of body swelling
        hanging there
        not really quite knowing,
        and then knowing-
        something sending it down its string,
        the wet web,
        toward the weak shield of buzzing,
        the pulsing;
        a last desperate moving hair-leg
        there against the glass
        there alive in the sun,
        spun in white;
        and almost like love:
        the closing over,
        the first hushed spider-sucking:
        filling its sack
        upon this thing that lived;
        crouching there upon its back
        drawing its certain blood
        as the world goes by outside
        and my temples scream
        and I hurl the broom against them:
        the spider dull with spider-anger
        still thinking of its prey
        and waving an amazed broken leg;
        the fly very still,
        a dirty speck stranded to straw;
        I shake the killer loose
        and he walks lame and peeved
        towards some dark corner
        but I intercept his dawdling
        his crawling like some broken hero,
        and the straws smash his legs
        now waving
        above his head
        and looking
        looking for the enemy
        and somewhat valiant,
        dying without apparent pain
        simply crawling backward
        piece by piece

        leaving nothing there
        until at last the red gut sack
        splashes
        its secrets,
        and I run child-like
        with God's anger a step behind,
        back to simple sunlight,
        wondering
        as the world goes by
        with curled smile
        if anyone else
        saw or sensed my crime
        





        Decline
        naked along the side of the house,
        8 a.m., spreading sesame seed oil
        over my body, Jesus, have I come
        to this?
        I once battled in dark alleys for a
        laugh.
        now I'm not laughing.
        I splash myself with oil and wonder,
        how many years do you want?
        how many days?
        my blood is soiled and a dark
        angel sits in my brain.
        things are made of something and
        go to nothing.
        I understand the fall of cities, of
        nations.
        a small plane passes overhead.
        I look upward as if it made sense to
        look upward.
        it's true, the sky has rotted:
        it won't be long for any of
        us.
        





        Eat Your Heart Out
        I've come by, she says, to tell you
        that this is it. I'm not kidding, it's
        over. this is it.
        I sit on the couch watching her arrange
        her long red hair before my bedroom
        mirror.
        she pulls her hair up and
        piles it on top of her head-
        she lets her eyes look at
        my eyes-
        then she drops her hair and
        lets it fall down in front of her face.
        we go to bed and I hold her
        speechlessly from the back
        my arm around her neck
        I touch her wrists and hands
        feel up to
        her elbows
        no further.
        she gets up.
        this is it, she says,
        this will do. well,
        I'm going.
        I get up and walk her
        to the door
        just as she leaves
        she says,
        I want you to buy me
        some high-heeled shoes
        with tall thin spikes,
        black high-heeled shoes.
        no, I want them
        red.
        I watch her walk down the cement walk
        under the trees
        she walks all right and
        as the pointsettas drip in the sun
        I close the door.
        

        Eulogy To A Hell Of A Dame
        some dogs who sleep At night
        must dream of bones
        and I remember your bones
        in flesh
        and best
        in that dark green dress
        and those high-heeled bright
        black shoes,
        you always cursed when you drank,
        your hair coming down you
        wanted to explode out of
        what was holding you:
        rotten memories of a
        rotten
        past, and
        you finally got
        out
        by dying,
        leaving me with the
        rotten
        present;
        you've been dead
        28 years
        yet I remember you
        better than any of
        the rest;
        you were the only one
        who understood
        the futility of the
        arrangement of
        life;
        all the others were only
        displeased with
        trivial segments,
        carped
        nonsensically about
        nonsense;
        Jane, you were
        killed by
        knowing too much.
        here's a drink
        to your bones
        that
        this dog
        still
        dreams about.
        





        Finish
        We are like roses that have never bothered to
        bloom when we should have bloomed and
        it is as if
        the sun has become disgusted with
        waiting
        





        finished?
        the critics now have me
        drinking champagne and
        driving a BMW
        and also married to a
        socialite from
        Philadelphia's Main Line
        which of course is going to prevent me
        from writing my earthy
        and grubby stuff.
        and they might be
        right,
        I could be getting to be
        more like them,
        and that's as close to
        death as you can
        get.
        we'll see.
        but don't bury me yet.
        don't worry if I drink with
        Sean Penn.
        just measure the poems
        as they come off the
        keyboard.
        listen only to them.
        after this long fight
        I have no intention of
        quitting short.
        or late.
        or satisfied.
        





        Flophouse
        you haven't lived
        until you've been in a
        flophouse
        with nothing but one
        light bulb
        and 56 men
        squeezed together
        on cots
        with everybody
        snoring
        at once
        and some of those
        snores
        so
        deep and
        gross and
        unbelievable-
        dark
        snotty
        gross
        subhuman
        wheezings
        from hell
        itself.
        your mind
        almost breaks
        under those
        death-like
        sounds
        and the
        intermingling
        odors:
        hard
        unwashed socks
        pissed and
        shitted
        underwear
        and over it all
        slowly circulating
        air
        much like that
        emanating from
        uncovered
        garbage
        cans.
        and those
        bodies
        in the dark
        fat and
        thin
        and
        bent

        some
        legless
        armless
        some
        mindless
        and worst of
        all:
        the total
        absence of
        hope
        it shrouds
        them
        covers them
        totally.
        it's not
        bearable.
        you get
        up
        go out
        walk the
        streets
        up and
        down
        sidewalks
        past buildings
        around the
        corner
        and back
        up
        the samestreet
        thinking
        those men
        were all
        children
        once
        what has happened
        to
        them?
        and what has
        happened
        to
        me?
        it's dark
        and cold
        out
        here.
        





        For Jane
        225 days under grass
        and you know more than I.
        they have long taken your blood,
        you are a dry stick in a basket.
        is this how it works?
        in this room
        the hours of love
        still make shadows.
        when you left
        you took almost
        everything.
        I kneel in the nights
        before tigers
        that will not let me be.
        what you were
        will not happen again.
        the tigers have found me
        and I do not care.
        





        For Jane: With All The Love I Had, Which Was Not Enough
        I pick up the skirt,
        I pick up the sparkling beads
        in black,
        this thing that moved once
        around flesh,
        and I call God a liar,
        I say anything that moved
        like that
        or knew
        my name
        could never die
        in the common verity of dying,
        and I pick
        up her lovely
        dress,
        all her loveliness gone,
        and I speak to all the gods,
        Jewish gods, Christ-gods,
        chips of blinking things,
        idols, pills, bread,
        fathoms, risks,
        knowledgeable surrender,
        rats in the gravy of 2 gone quite mad
        without a chance,
        hummingbird knowledge, hummingbird chance,
        I lean upon this,
        I lean on all of this
        and I know:
        her dress upon my arm:
        but
        they will not
        give her back to me.

        Freedom
        he drank wine all night of the
        28th, and he kept thinking of her:
        the way she walked and talked and loved
        the way she told him things that seemed true
        but were not, and he knew the color of each
        of her dresses
        and her shoes-he knew the stock and curve of
        each heel
        as well as the leg shaped by it.
        and she was out again and when he came home,and
        she'd come back with that special stink again,
        and she did
        she came in at 3 a.m in the morning
        filthy like a dung eating swine
        and
        he took out a butchers knife
        and she screamed
        backing into the rooming house wall
        still pretty somehow
        in spite of love's reek
        and he finished the glass of wine.
        that yellow dress
        his favorite
        and she screamed again.
        and he took up the knife
        and unhooked his belt
        and tore away the cloth before her
        and cut off his balls.
        and carried them in his hands
        like apricots
        and flushed them down the
        toilet bowl
        and she kept screaming
        as the room became red
        GOD O GOD!
        WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
        and he sat there holding 3 towels
        between his legs
        no caring now whether she left or
        stayed
        wore yellow or green or
        anything at all.
        and one hand holding and one hand
        lifting he poured
        another wine

        





        Friends Within The Darkness
        I can remember starving in a
        small room in a strange city
        shades pulled down, listening to
        classical music
        I was young I was so young it hurt like a knife
        inside
        because there was no alternative except to hide as long
        as possible--
        not in self-pity but with dismay at my limited chance:
        trying to connect.
        the old composers -- Mozart, Bach, Beethoven,
        Brahms were the only ones who spoke to me and
        they were dead.
        finally, starved and beaten, I had to go into
        the streets to be interviewed for low-paying and
        monotonous
        jobs
        by strange men behind desks
        men without eyes men without faces
        who would take away my hours
        break them
        piss on them.
        now I work for the editors the readers the
        critics
        but still hang around and drink with
        Mozart, Bach, Brahms and the
        Bee
        some buddies
        some men
        sometimes all we need to be able to continue alone
        are the dead
        rattling the walls
        that close us in.

        gamblers all
        sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think,
        <i>I'm not going to make it</i>, but you laugh inside
        remembering all the times you've felt that way, and
        you walk to the bathroom, do your toilet, see that face
        in the mirror, oh my oh my oh my, but you comb your hair anyway,
        get into your street clothes, feed the cats, fetch the
        newspaper of horror, place it on the coffee table, kiss your
        wife goodbye, and then you are backing the car out into life itself,
        like millions of others you enter the arena once more.
        you are on the freeway threading through traffic now,
        moving both towards something and towards nothing at all as you punch
        the radio on and get Mozart, which is something, and you will somehow
        get through the slow days and the busy days and the dull
        days and the hateful days and the rare days, all both so delightful
        and so disappointing because
        we are all so alike and so different.
        you find the turn-off, drive through the most dangerous
        part of town, feel momentarily wonderful as Mozart works
        his way into your brain and slides down along your bones and
        out through your shoes.
        it's been a tough fight worth fighting
        as we all drive along
        betting on another day.
        





        Girl In A Miniskirt Reading The Bible Outside My Window
        Sunday, I am eating a
        grapefruit, church is over at the Russian
        Orthadox to the
        west.
        she is dark
        of Eastern descent,
        large brown eyes look up from the Bible
        then down. a small red and black
        Bible, and as she reads
        her legs keep moving, moving,
        she is doing a slow rythmic dance
        reading the Bible. . .
        long gold earrings;
        2 gold bracelets on each arm,
        and it's a mini-suit, I suppose,
        the cloth hugs her body,
        the lightest of tans is that cloth,
        she twists this way and that,
        long yellow legs warm in the sun. . .
        there is no escaping her being
        there is no desire to. . .
        my radio is playing symphonic music
        that she cannot hear
        but her movements coincide exactly
        to the rythms of the
        symphony. . .
        she is dark, she is dark
        she is reading about God.
        I am God.
        





        having the flu and with nothing else to do
        I read a book about John Dos Passos and according to
        the book once radical-communist
        John ended up in the Hollywood Hills living off investments
        and reading the
        <i>Wall Street Journal </i>
        this seems to happen all too often.
        what hardly ever happens is
        a man going from being a young conservative to becoming an
        old wild-ass radical
        however:
        young conservatives always seem to become old
        conservatives.
        it's a kind of lifelong mental vapor-lock.
        but when a young radical ends up an
        old radical
        the critics
        and the conservatives
        treat him as if he escaped from a mental
        institution.
        such is our politics and you can have it
        all.
        keep it.
        sail it up your
        ass.
        





        hello, how are you?
        this fear of being what they are:
        dead.
        at least they are not out on the street, they
        are careful to stay indoors, those
        pasty mad who sit alone before their tv sets,
        their lives full of canned, mutilated laughter.
        their ideal neighborhood
        of parked cars
        of little green lawns
        of little homes
        the little doors that open and close
        as their relatives visit
        throughout the holidays
        the doors closing
        behind the dying who die so slowly
        behind the dead who are still alive
        in your quiet average neighborhood
        of winding streets
        of agony
        of confusion
        of horror
        of fear
        of ignorance.
        a dog standing behind a fence.
        a man silent at the window.
        





        Here I Am ...
        drunk again at 3 a.m. at the end of my 2nd bottle
        of wine, I have typed from a dozen to 15 pages of
        poesy
        an old man
        maddened for the flesh of young girls in this
        dwindling twilight
        liver gone
        kidneys going
        pancrea pooped
        top-floor blood pressure
        





        His Wife, The Painter
        There are sketches on the walls of men and women and ducks,
        and outside a large green bus swerves through traffic like
        insanity sprung from a waving line; Turgenev, Turgenev,
        says the radio, and Jane Austin, Jane Austin, too.
        &quot;I am going to do her portrait on the 28th, while you are
        at work.&quot;
        





        Hooray Say The Roses
        hooray say the roses, today is blamesday
        and we are red as blood.
        hooray say the roses, today is Wednesday
        and we bloom wher soldiers fell
        and lovers too,
        and the snake at the word.
        hooray say the roses, darkness comes
        all at once, like lights gone out,
        the sun leaves dark continents
        and rows of stone.
        hooray say the roses, cannons and spires,
        birds, bees, bombers, today is Friday
        the hand holding a medal out the window,
        a moth going by, half a mile an hour,
        hooray hooray
        hooray say the roses
        we have empires on our stems,
        the sun moves the mouth:
        hooray hooray hooray
        and that is why you like us.

        Hot
        she was hot, she was so hot
        I didn't want anybody else to have her,
        and if I didn't get home on time
        she'd be gone, and I couldn't bear that-
        I'd go mad. . .
        it was foolish I know, childish,
        but I was caught in it, I was caught.
        I delivered all the mail
        and then Henderson put me on the night pickup run
        in an old army truck,
        the damn thing began to heat halfway through the run
        and the night went on
        me thinking about my hot Miriam
        and jumping in and out of the truck
        filling mailsacks
        the engine continuing to heat up
        the temperature needle was at the top
        HOT HOT
        like Miriam.
        leaped in and out
        3 more pickups and into the station
        I'd be, my car
        waiting to get me to Miriam who sat on my blue couch
        with scotch on the rocks
        crossing her legs and swinging her ankles
        like she did,
        2 more stops. . .
        the truck stalled at a traffic light, it was hell
        kicking it over
        again. . .
        I had to be home by 8,8 was the deadline for Miriam.
        I made the last pickup and the truck stalled at a signal
        1/2 block from the station. . .
        it wouldn't start, it couldn't start. . .
        I locked the doors, pulled the key and ran down to the
        station. . .
        I threw the keys down. . .signed out. . .
        your goddamned truck is stalled at the signal,
        I shouted,
        Pico and Western. . .
        . . .I ran down the hall,put the key into the door,
        opened it. . .her drinking glass was there, and a note:
        





        How Is Your Heart?
        during my worst times
        on the park benches
        in the jails
        or living with
        whores
        I always had this certain
        contentment-
        I wouldn't call it
        happiness-
        it was more of an inner
        balance
        that settled for
        whatever was occuring
        and it helped in the
        factories
        and when relationships
        went wrong
        with the
        girls.
        





        I like your books
        In the betting line the other
        day
        man behind me asked,
        "are you Henry
        Chinaski?"
        "uh huh," I answered.
        "I like your books," he went
        on.
        "thanks," I answered.
        "who do you like in this
        race?" he asked.
        "uh uh," I answered.
        "I like the 4 horse," he
        told me.
        I made my bet and went back
        to my seat....
        the next race I am standing in
        line and here is this same man
        standing behind me
        again.
        there are at least 50 lines at
        the windows but
        he has to find mine
        again.
        "I think this race favors the
        closers," he said to the back of
        my neck. "the track looks
        heavy."
        "listen," I said, not looking
        around, "it's the kiss of death to
        talk about horses at the
        track..."
        "what kind of rule is that?"
        he asked. "God doesn't make
        rules..."
        I turned around and looked at him:
        "maybe not, but I
        do."
        after the next race

        I got in line, glanced behind
        me:
        he was not there:
        lost another reader.
        I lose 2 or 3 each
        week.
        fine.
        let 'em go back to
        Kafka.
        





        I Made A Mistake
        I reached up into the top of the closet
        and took out a pair of blue panties
        and showed them to her and
        asked &quot;are these yours?&quot;
        





        I Met A Genius
        I met a genius on the train
        today
        about 6 years old,
        he sat beside me
        and as the train
        ran down along the coast
        we came to the ocean
        and then he looked at me
        and said,
        it's not pretty.
        





        I'm In Love
        she's young, she said,
        but look at me,
        I have pretty ankles,
        and look at my wrists, I have pretty
        wrists
        o my god,
        I thought it was all working,
        and now it's her again,
        every time she phones you go crazy,
        you told me it was over
        you told me it was finished,
        listen, I've lived long enough to become a
        good woman,
        why do you need a bad woman?
        you need to be tortured, don't you?
        you think life is rotten if somebody treats you
        rotten it all fits,
        doesn't it?
        tell me, is that it? do you want to be treated like a
        piece of shit?
        and my son, my son was going to meet you.
        I told my son
        and I dropped all my lovers.
        I stood up in a cafe and screamed
        I'M IN LOVE,
        and now you've made a fool of me. . .
        I'm sorry, I said, I'm really sorry.
        hold me, she said, will you please hold me?
        I've never been in one of these things before, I said,
        these triangles. . .
        she got up and lit a cigarette, she was trembling all
        over.she paced up and down,wild and crazy.she had
        a small body.her arms were thin,very thin and when
        she screamed and started beating me I held her
        wrists and then I got it through the eyes:hatred,
        centuries deep and true.I was wrong and graceless and
        sick.all the things I had learned had been wasted.
        there was no creature living as foul as I
        and all my poems were
        false.
        





        it was just a little while ago
        almost dawn
        blackbirds on the telephone wire
        waiting
        as I eat yesterday's
        forgotten sandwich
        at 6 a.m.
        an a quiet Sunday morning.
        one shoe in the corner
        standing upright
        the other laying on it's
        side.
        yes, some lives were made to be
        wasted.
        





        It's Ours
        there is always that space there
        just before they get to us
        that space
        that fine relaxer
        the breather
        while say
        flopping on a bed
        thinking of nothing
        or say
        pouring a glass of water from the
        spigot
        while entranced by
        nothing
        that
        gentle pure
        space
        it's worth
        centuries of
        existence
        say
        just to scratch your neck
        while looking out the window at
        a bare branch
        that space
        there
        before they get to us
        ensures
        that
        when they do
        they won't
        get it all
        ever.

        Layover
        Making love in the sun, in the morning sun
        in a hotel room
        above the alley
        where poor men poke for bottles;
        making love in the sun
        making love by a carpet redder than our blood,
        making love while the boys sell headlines
        and Cadillacs,
        making love by a photograph of Paris
        and an open pack of Chesterfields,
        making love while other men- poor folks-
        work.
        That moment- to this. . .
        may be years in the way they measure,
        but it's only one sentence back in my mind-
        there are so many days
        when living stops and pulls up and sits
        and waits like a train on the rails.
        I pass the hotel at 8
        and at 5; there are cats in the alleys
        and bottles and bums,
        and I look up at the window and think,
        I no longer know where you are,
        and I walk on and wonder where
        the living goes
        when it stops.
        





        Let It Enfold You
        either peace or happiness,
        let it enfold you
        when I was a young man
        I felt these things were
        dumb, unsophisticated.
        I had bad blood, a twisted
        mind, a precarious
        upbringing.
        I was hard as granite, I
        leered at the
        sun.
        I trusted no man and
        especially no
        woman.
        I was living a hell in
        small rooms, I broke
        things, smashed things,
        walked through glass,
        cursed.
        I challenged everything,
        was continually being
        evicted, jailed,in and
        out of fights, in and out
        of my mind.
        women were something
        to screw and rail
        at, I had no male
        freinds,
        I changed jobs and
        cities, I hated holidays,
        babies, history,
        newspapers, museums,
        grandmothers,
        marriage, movies,
        spiders, garbagemen,
        english accents,spain,
        france,italy,walnuts and
        the color
        orange.
        algebra angred me,
        opera sickened me,
        charlie chaplin was a
        fake
        and flowers were for
        pansies.
        peace an happiness to me
        were signs of

        inferiority,
        tenants of the weak
        an
        addled
        mind.
        but as I went on with
        my alley fights,
        my suicidal years,
        my passage through
        any number of
        women-it gradually
        began to occur to
        me
        that I wasn't different
        from the
        others, I was the same,
        they were all fulsome
        with hatred,
        glossed over with petty
        greivances,
        the men I fought in
        alleys had hearts of stone.
        everybody was nudging,
        inching, cheating for
        some insignificant
        advantage,
        the lie was the
        weapon and the
        plot was
        empty,
        darkness was the
        dictator.
        cautiously, I allowed
        myself to feel good
        at times.
        I found moments of
        peace in cheap
        rooms
        just staring at the
        knobs of some
        dresser
        or listening to the
        rain in the
        dark.
        the less I needed
        the better I
        felt.


        maybe the other life had worn me
        down.
        I no longer found
        glamour
        in topping somebody
        in conversation.
        or in mounting the
        body of some poor
        drunken female
        whose life had
        slipped away into
        sorrow.
        I could never accept
        life as it was,
        i could never gobble
        down all its
        poisons
        but there were parts,
        tenous magic parts
        open for the
        asking.
        I re formulated
        I don't know when,
        date, time, all
        that
        but the change
        occured.
        something in me
        relaxed, smoothed
        out.
        i no longer had to
        prove that I was a
        man,
        I did'nt have to prove
        anything.
        I began to see things:
        coffee cups lined up
        behind a counter in a
        cafe.
        or a dog walking along
        a sidewalk.
        or the way the mouse
        on my dresser top
        stopped there
        with its body,
        its ears,
        its nose,
        it was fixed,

        a bit of life
        caught within itself
        and its eyes looked
        at me
        and they were
        beautiful.
        then- it was
        gone.
        I began to feel good,
        I began to feel good
        in the worst situations
        and there were plenty
        of those.
        like say, the boss
        behind his desk,
        he is going to have
        to fire me.
        I've missed too many
        days.
        he is dressed in a
        suit, necktie, glasses,
        he says, "I am going
        to have to let you go"
        "it's all right" I tell
        him.
        He must do what he
        must do, he has a
        wife, a house, children.
        expenses, most probably
        a girlfreind.
        I am sorry for him
        he is caught.
        I walk onto the blazing
        sunshine.
        the whole day is
        mine
        temporailiy,
        anyhow.
        (the whole world is at the
        throat of the world,
        everybody feels angry,
        short-changed, cheated,
        everybody is despondent,
        dissillusioned)


        I welcomed shots of
        peace, tattered shards of
        happiness.
        I embraced that stuff
        like the hottest number,
        like high heels, breasts,
        singing,the
        works.
        (dont get me wrong,
        there is such a thing as cockeyed optimism
        that overlooks all
        basic problems just for
        the sake of
        itself-
        this is a shield and a
        sickness.)
        The knife got near my
        throat again,
        I almost turned on the
        gas
        again
        but when the good
        moments arrived
        again
        I did'nt fight them off
        like an alley
        adversary.
        I let them take me,
        i luxuriated in them,
        I bade them welcome
        home.
        I even looked into
        the mirror
        once having thought
        myself to be
        ugly,
        I now liked what
        I saw,almost
        handsome, yes,
        a bit ripped and
        ragged,
        scares, lumps,
        odd turns,
        but all in all,
        not too bad,
        almost handsome,
        better at least than
        some of those movie
        star faces

        like the cheeks of
        a baby's
        butt.
        and finally I discovered
        real feelings of
        others,
        unheralded,
        like lately,
        like this morning,
        as I was leaving,
        for the track,
        i saw my wife in bed,
        just the
        shape of
        her head there
        (not forgetting
        centuries of the living
        and the dead and
        the dying,
        the pyramids,
        Mozart dead
        but his music still
        there in the
        room, weeds growing,
        the earth turning,
        the toteboard waiting for
        me)
        I saw the shape of my
        wife's head,
        she so still,
        I ached for her life,
        just being there
        under the
        covers.
        I kissed her in the,
        forehead,
        got down the stairway,
        got outside,
        got into my marvelous
        car,
        fixed the seatbelt,
        backed out the
        drive.
        feeling warm to
        the fingertips,
        down to my
        foot on the gas
        pedal,
        I entered the world
        once

        more,
        drove down the
        hill
        past the houses
        full and empty
        of
        people,
        I saw the mailman,
        honked,
        he waved
        back
        at me.

        Like A Flower In The Rain
        I cut the middle fingernail of the middle
        finger
        right hand
        real short
        and I began rubbing along her cunt
        as she sat upright in bed
        spreading lotion over her arms
        face
        and breasts
        after bathing.
        then she lit a cigarette:
        &quot;don't let this put you off,&quot;
        an smoked and continued to rub
        the lotion on.
        I continued to rub the cunt.
        &quot;You want an apple?&quot; I asked.
        &quot;sure, she said, &quot;you got one?&quot;
        but I got to her-
        she began to twist
        then she rolled on her side,
        she was getting wet and open
        like a flower in the rain.
        then she rolled on her stomach
        and her most beautiful ass
        looked up at me
        and I reached under and got the
        cunt again.
        she reached around and got my
        cock, she rolled and twisted,
        I mounted
        my face falling into the mass
        of red hair that overflowed
        from her head
        and my flattened cock entered
        into the miracle.
        later we joked about the lotion
        and the cigarette and the apple.
        then I went out and got some chicken
        and shrimp and french fries and buns
        and mashed potatoes and gravy and
        cole slaw,and we ate.she told me
        how good she felt and I told her
        how good I felt and we
        ate the chicken and the shrimp and the
        french fries and the buns and the
        mashed potatoes and the gravy and
        the cole slaw too.
        




        Love & Fame & Death
        it sits outside my window now
        like and old woman going to market;
        it sits and watches me,
        it sweats nervously
        through wire and fog and dog-bark
        until suddenly
        I slam the screen with a newspaper
        like slapping at a fly
        and you could hear the scream
        over this plain city,
        and then it left.
        the way to end a poem
        like this
        is to become suddenly
        quiet.

        Luck
        once
        we were young
        at this
        machine. . .
        





        magical mystery tour
        I am in this low-slung sports car
        painted a deep, rich yellow
        driving under an Italian sun.
        I have a British accent.
        I'm wearing dark shades
        an expensive silk shirt.
        there's no dirt under my
        fingernails.
        the radio plays Vivaldi
        and there are two women with
        me
        one with raven hair
        the other a blonde.
        they have small breasts and
        beautiful legs
        and they laugh at everything I
        say.
        as we drive up a steep road
        the blonde squeezes my leg
        and nestles closer
        while raven hair
        leans across and nibbles my
        ear.
        we stop for lunch at a quaint
        rustic inn.
        there is more laughter
        before lunch
        during lunch and after
        lunch.
        after lunch we will have a
        flat tire on the other side of
        the mountain
        and the blonde will change the
        tire
        while
        raven hair
        photographs me
        lighting my pipe
        leaning against a tree
        the perfect background
        perfectly at peace
        with
        sunlight
        flowers
        clouds
        birds
        everywhere.
        

        Mama
        here I am   in the ground
                             andopen
                                   my mouth

                   I can't even say
                             mama,
        the dogs run by and stop and piss
                                 and
        on my stone; I get it all
        except the sun
        and my suit is looking
        and yesterday                     bad
                               the last of my left
        very little left, all harp-like         arm  gone
        without music.
        at least a drunk
        in bed with a cigarette
        might cause 5 fire          engines and
                                    33 men.
        I can't  do    any   thing.
        but p.s. -- Hector Richmond in the next
        tomb thinks only of Mozart and candy
        caterpillars.
                 he is  very bad   company.

        Marina
        majestic, majic
        infinite
        my little girl is
        sun
        on the carpet-
        out the door
        picking a flower, ha!
        an old man,
        battle-wrecked,
        emerges from his
        chair
        and she looks at me
        but only sees
        love,
        ha!, and I become
        quick with the world
        and love right back
        just like I was meant
        to do.
        





        Melancholia
        the history of melancholia
        includes all of us.
        





        Metamorphosis
        a girlfriend came in
        built me a bed
        scrubbed and waxed the kitchen floor
        scrubbed the walls
        vacuumed
        cleaned the toilet
        the bathtub
        scrubbed the bathroom floor
        and cut my toenails and
        my hair.
        then
        all on the same day
        the plumber came and fixed the kitchen faucet
        and the toilet
        and the gas man fixed the heater
        and the phone man fixed the phone.
        noe I sit in all this perfection.
        it is quiet.
        I have broken off with all 3 of my girlfriends.
        I felt better when everything was in
        disorder.
        it will take me some months to get back to normal:
        I can't even find a roach to commune with.
        I have lost my rythm.
        I can't sleep.
        I can't eat.
        I have been robbed of
        my filth.
        





        my computer
        "what?" they say, "you got a
        <i>computer</i>?"
        it's like I have sold out to
        the enemy.
        I had no idea so many
        people were prejudiced
        against
        computers.
        even two editors have
        written me letters about
        the computer.
        one disparaged the
        computer in a mild and
        superior way.
        the other seemed
        genuinely
        pissed.
        I am aware that a
        computer can't create
        a poem.
        but neither can a
        typewriter.
        yet, still, once or
        twice a week
        I hear:
        "what?
        you have a
        <i>computer</i>?
        <i>you</i>?"
        yes, I do
        and I sit up here
        almost every
        night,
        sometimes with
        beer or
        wine,
        sometimes
        without
        and I work the
        computer.
        the damn thing
        even corrects
        my spelling.
        and the poems

        come flying
        out,
        better than
        ever.
        I have no
        idea what causes
        all this
        computer
        prejudice.
        me?
        I want to go
        the next step
        beyond the
        computer.
        I'm sure it's
        there.
        and when I get
        it,
        they'll say,
        "hey, you hear,
        Chinaski got a
        <i>space-biter</i>!"
        "what?"
        "yes, it's true!"
        "I can't believe
        it!"
        and I'll also have
        some beer or
        some wine
        or maybe nothing
        at all
        and I'll be
        85 years old
        driving it home
        to
        you and me
        and to the little girl
        who lost her
        sheep.
        or her
        computer.
        



        my father
        was a truly amazing man
        he pretended to be
        rich
        even though we lived on beans and mush and weenies
        when we sat down to eat, he said,
        "not everybody can eat like this."
        and because he wanted to be rich or because he actually
        thought he was rich
        he always voted Republican
        and he voted for Hoover against Roosevelt
        and he lost
        and then he voted for Alf Landon against Roosevelt
        and he lost again
        saying, "I don't know what this world is coming to,
        now we've got that god damned Red in there again
        and the Russians will be in our backyard next!"
        I think it was my father who made me decide to
        become a bum.
        I decided that if a man like that wants to be rich
        then I want to be poor.
        and I became a bum.
        I lived on nickles and dimes and in cheap rooms and
        on park benches.
        I thought maybe the bums knew something.
        but I found out that most of the bums wanted to be
        rich too.
        they had just failed at that.
        so caught between my father and the bums
        I had no place to go
        and I went there fast and slow.
        never voted Republican
        never voted.
        buried him
        like an oddity of the earth
        like a hundred thousand oddities
        like millions of other oddities,
        wasted.
        





        My First Affair With That Older Woman
        when I look back now
        at the abuse I took from
        her
        I feel shame that I was so
        innocent,
        but I must say
        she did match me drink for
        drink,
        and I realized that her life
        her feelings for things
        had been ruined
        along the way
        and that I was no mare than a
        temporary
        companion;
        she was ten years older
        and mortally hurt by the past
        and the present;
        she treated me badly:
        desertion, other
        men;
        she brought me immense
        pain,
        continually;
        she lied, stole;
        there was desertion,


        other men,
        yet we had our moments; and
        our little soap opera ended
        with her in a coma
        in the hospital,
        and I sat at her bed
        for hours
        talking to her,
        and then she opened her eyes
        and saw me:
        &quot;I knew it would be you,&quot;
        she said.
        then hse closed her
        eyes.

        the next day she was
        dead.

        I drank alone
        for two years
        after that.
        





        my friend, the parking lot attendant
        --he's a dandy
        --small moustache
        --usually sucking on a cigar
        he tends to lean into cars as he
        transacts business
        first time I met him, he said,
        "hey! ya gonna make a
        killin'?"
        "maybe," I answered.
        next meeting it was:
        "hey, Ramrod! what's
        happening?"
        "very little," I told
        him.
        next time I had my girlfriend with me
        and he just
        grinned.
        next time I was
        alone.
        "hey," he asked, "where's the young
        chick?"
        "I left her at home...."
        "<i>Bullshit</i>! I'll bet she dumped
        you!"
        and the next time
        he really leaned into the car:
        "what's a guy like <i>you</i> doing driving a
        BMW! I'll bet you inherited your
        money, you didn't get this car with your
        brains!"
        "how'd you guess?" I
        answered.
        that was some weeks ago.
        I haven't seen him lately.
        feIlow like that, chances are he just moved on
        to better
        things.


        





        My Groupie
        I read last Saturday in the
        redwoods outside of Santa Cruz
        and I was about 3/4's finished
        when I heard a long high scream
        and a quite attractive
        young girl came running toward me
        long gown &amp; divine eyes of fire
        and she leaped up on the stage
        and screamed: &quot;I WANT YOU!
        I WANT YOU! TAKE ME! TAKE
        ME!&quot;
        I told her, &quot;look, get the hell
        away from me.&quot;
        but she kept tearing at my
        clothing and throwing herself
        at me.
        &quot;where were you,&quot; I
        asked her, &quot;when I was living
        on one candy bar a day and
        sending short stories to the
        Atlantic Monthly?&quot;
        she grabbed my balls and almost
        twisted them off. her kisses
        tasted like shitsoup.
        2 women jumped up on the stage
        and
        carried her off into the
        woods.
        I could still hear her screams
        as I began the next poem.
        mabye, I thought, I should have
        taken her on stage in front
        of all those eyes.
        but one can never be sure
        whether it's good poetry or
        bad acid.
        





        New Mexico
        I was fairly drunk when it
        began and I took out my bottle and used it
        along the way. I was reading a week or two after
        Kandel and I did not look quite as
        pretty but
        I brought it off and we
        ended up at the Webbs, 6, 8, 10 of
        us, and I drank scotch, wine, beer, tequila
        and noticed a nice one sitting next to me -
        one tooth missing when she smiled,
        lovely, and I put my arm around her
        and began loading her with bullshit. when I awakened at 10 a.m. the next morning
        I was in a strange house
        in bed with this
        woman. she was asleep but looked
        familiar.

        I'll settle for the 6 horse
        





        Now
        I sit here on the 2nd floor
        hunched over in yellow
        pajamas
        still pretending to be
        a writer.
        some damned gall,
        at 71,
        my brain cells eaten
        away by
        life.
        rows of books
        behind me,
        I scratch my thinning
        hair
        and search for the
        word.
        





        O, We Are The Outcasts
        ah, christ, what a CREW:
        more
        poetry, always more
        P O E T R Y .
        if it doesn't come, coax it out with a
        laxative. get your name in LIGHTS,
        get it up there in
        8 1/2 x 11 mimeo.
        keep it coming like a miracle.
        ah christ, writers are the most sickening
        of all the louts!
        yellow-toothed, slump-shouldered,
        gutless, flea-bitten and
        obvious . . . in tinker-toy rooms
        with their flabby hearts
        they tell us
        what's wrong with the world-
        as if we didn't know that a cop's club
        can crack the head
        and that war is a dirtier game than
        marriage . . .
        or down in a basement bar
        hiding from a wife who doesn't appreciate him
        and children he doesn't
        want
        he tells us that his heart is drowning in
        vomit. hell, all our hearts are drowning in vomit,
        in pork salt, in bad verse, in soggy
        love.
        but he thinks he's alone and
        he thinks he's special and he thinks he's Rimbaud
        and he thinks he's
        Pound.
        and death! how about death? did you know
        that we all have to die? even Keats died, even
        Milton!
        and D. Thomas-THEY KILLED HIM, of course.
        Thomas didn't want all those free drinks
        all that free pussy-
        they . . . FORCED IT ON HIM
        when they should have left him alone so he could
        write write WRITE!
        poets.
        and there's another
        type. I've met them at their country
        places (don't ask me what I was doing there because

        I don't know).
        they were born with money and
        they don't have to dirty their hands in
        slaughterhouses or washing
        dishes in grease joints or
        driving cabs or pimping or selling pot.
        this gives them time to understand
        Life.
        they walk in with their cocktail glass
        held about heart high
        and when they drink they just
        sip.
        you are drinking green beer which you
        brought with you
        because you have found out through the years
        that rich bastards are tight-
        they use 5 cent stamps instead of airmail
        they promise to have all sorts of goodies ready
        upon your arrival
        from gallons of whisky to
        50 cent cigars. but it's never
        there.
        and they HIDE their women from you-
        their wives, x-wives, daughters, maids, so forth,
        because they've read your poems and
        figure all you want to do is fuck everybody and
        everything. which once might have been
        true but is no longer quite
        true.
        and-
        he WRITES TOO.
        POETRY, of
        course. everybody
        writes
        poetry.
        he has plenty of time and a
        postoffice box in town
        and he drives there 3 or 4 times a day
        looking and hoping for accepted
        poems.
        he thinks that poverty is a weakness of the
        soul.
        he thinks your mind is ill because you are
        drunk all the time and have to work in a

        factory 10 or 12 hours a
        night.
        he brings his wife in, a beauty, stolen from a
        poorer rich
        man.
        he lets you gaze for 30 seconds
        then hustles her
        out. she has been crying for some
        reason.
        you've got 3 or 4 days to linger in the
        guesthouse he says,
        &quot;come on over to dinner
        sometime.&quot;
        but he doesn't say when or
        where. and then you find out that you are not even
        IN HIS HOUSE.
        you are in
        ONE of his houses but
        his house is somewhere
        else-
        you don't know
        where.
        he even has x-wives in some of his
        houses.
        his main concern is to keep his x-wives away from
        you. he doesn't want to give up a
        damn thing. and you can't blame him:
        his x-wives are all young, stolen, kept,
        talented, well-dressed, schooled, with
        varying French-German accents.
        and!: they
        WRITE POETRY TOO. or
        PAINT. or
        fuck.
        but his big problem is to get down to that mail
        box in town to get back his
        rejected poems
        and to keep his eye on all the other mail boxes
        in all his other
        houses.
        meanwhile, the starving Indians
        sell beads and baskets in the streets of the small desert
        town.


        the Indians are not allowed in his houses
        not so much because they are a fuck-threat
        but because they are
        dirty and
        ignorant. dirty? I look down at my shirt
        with the beerstain on the front.
        ignorant? I light a 6 cent cigar and
        forget about
        it.
        he or they or somebody was supposed to meet me at
        the
        train station.
        of course, they weren't
        there. &quot;We'll be there to meet the great
        Poet!&quot;
        well, I looked around and didn't see any
        great poet. besides it was 7 a.m. and
        40 degrees. those things
        happen. the trouble was there were no
        bars open. nothing open. not even a
        jail.
        he's a poet.
        he's also a doctor, a head-shrinker.
        no blood involved that
        way. he won't tell me whether I am crazy or
        not-I don't have the
        money.
        he walks out with his cocktail glass
        disappears for 2 hours, 3 hours,
        then suddenly comes walking back in
        unannounced
        with the same cocktail glass
        to make sure I haven't gotten hold of
        something more precious than
        Life itself.
        my cheap green beer is killing
        me. he shows heart (hurrah) and
        gives me a little pill that stops my
        gagging.
        but nothing decent to
        drink.
        he'd bought a small 6 pack
        for my arrival but that was gone in an
        hour and 15
        minutes.

        &quot;I'll buy you barrels of beer,&quot; he had
        said.
        I used his phone (one of his phones)
        to get deliveries of beer and
        cheap whisky. the town was ten miles away,
        downhill. I peeled my poor dollars from my poor
        roll. and the boy needed a tip, of
        course.
        the way it was shaping up I could see that I was
        hardly Dylan Thomas yet, not even
        Robert Creeley. certainly Creeley wouldn't have
        had beerstains on his
        shirt.
        anyhow, when I finally got hold of one of his
        x-wives I was too drunk to
        make it.
        scared too. sure, I imagined him peering
        through the window-
        he didn't want to give up a damn thing-
        and
        leveling the luger while I was
        working
        while &quot;The March to the Gallows&quot; was playing over
        the Muzak
        and shooting me in the ass first and
        my poor brain
        later.
        &quot;an intruder,&quot; I could hear him telling them,
        &quot;ravishing one of my helpless x-wives.&quot;
        I see him published in some of the magazines
        now. not very good stuff.
        a poem about me
        too: the Polack.
        the Polack whines too much. the Polack whines about his
        country, other countries, all countries, the Polack
        works overtime in a factory like a fool, among other
        fools with &quot;pre-drained spirits.&quot;
        the Polack drinks seas of green beer
        full of acid. the Polack has an ulcerated
        hemorrhoid. the Polack picks on fags
        &quot;fragile fags.&quot; the Polack hates his
        wife, hates his daughter. his daughter will become
        an alcoholic, a prostitute. the Polack has an

        &quot;obese burned out wife.&quot; the Polack has a
        spastic gut. the Polack has a
        &quot;rectal brain.&quot;
        thank you, Doctor (and poet). any charge for
        this? I know I still owe you for the
        pill.
        Your poem is not too good
        but at least I got your starch up.
        most of your stuff is about as lively as a
        wet and deflated
        beachball. but it is your round, you've won a round.
        going to invite me out this
        Summer? I might scrape up
        trainfare. got an Indian friend who'd like to meet
        you and yours. he swears he's got the biggest
        pecker in the state of California.
        and guess what?
        he writes
        POETRY
        too!
        





        Oh Yes
        there are worse things than
        being alone
        but it often takes decades
        to realize this
        and most often
        when you do
        it's too late
        and there's nothing worse
        than
        too late.
        





        On Going Back To The Street After Viewing An Art Show
        they talk down through
        the centuries to us,
        and this we need more and more,
        the statues and paintings
        in midnight age
        as we go along
        holding dead hands.
        and we would say
        rather than delude the knowing:
        a damn good show,
        but hardly enough for a horse to eat,
        and out on the sunshine street where
        eyes are dabbled in metazoan faces
        i decide again
        that in theses centuries
        they have done very well
        considering the nature of their
        brothers:
        it's more than good
        that some of them,
        (closer really to the field-mouse than
        falcon)
        have been bold enough to try.

        one thirty-six a.m.
        I laugh sometimes when I think about
        say
        Cline at a typewriter
        or Dostoevsky...
        or Hamsun...
        ordinary men with feet, ears, eyes,
        ordinary men with hair on their heads
        sitting there typing words
        while having difficulties with life
        while being puzzled almost to madness.
        Dostoevsky gets up
        he leaves the machine to piss,
        comes back
        drinks a glass of milk and thinks about
        the casino and
        the roulette wheel.
        Cline stops, gets up, walks to the
        window, looks out, thinks, my last patient
        died today, I won't have to make any more
        visits there.
        when I saw him last
        he paid his doctor bill;
        it's those who don't pay their bills,
        they live on and on.
        Cline walks back, sits down at the
        machine
        is still for a good two minutes
        then begins to type.
        Hamsun stands over his machine thinking,
        I wonder if they are going to believe
        all these things I write?
        he sits down, begins to type.
        he doesn't know what a writer's block
        is:
        he's a prolific son-of-a-bitch
        damn near as magnificent as
        the sun.
        he types away.
        and I laugh
        not out loud
        but all up and down these walls, these
        dirty yellow and blue walls
        my white cat asleep on the
        table
        hiding his eyes from the
        light.
        he's not alone tonight

        and neither am
        I.
        





        Out Of The Arm Of One Love...
        out of the arm of one love
        and into the arms of another
        





        Paris
        never
        even in calmer times
        have I ever
        dreamed of
        bicycling through that
        city
        wearing a
        beret
        and
        Camus
        always
        pissed
        me

        Poem For My 43rd Birthday
        To end up alone
        in a tomb of a room
        without cigarettes
        or wine--
        just a lightbulb
        and a potbelly,
        grayhaired,
        and glad to have
        the room.

        Prayer In Bad Weather
        by God, I don't know what to
        





        Pull A String, A Puppet Moves
        each man must realize
        that it can all disappear very
        quickly:
        the cat, the woman, the job,
        the front tire,
        the bed, the walls, the
        room; all our necessities
        including love,
        rest on foundations of sand -
        and any given cause,
        no matter how unrelated:
        the death of a boy in Hong Kong
        or a blizzard in Omaha ...
        can serve as your undoing.
        all your chinaware crashing to the
        kitchen floor, your girl will enter
        and you'll be standing, drunk,
        in the center of it and she'll ask:
        my god, what's the matter?
        and you'll answer: I don't know,
        I don't know ...
        





        Question And Answer
        he sat naked and drunk in a room of summer
        night, running the blade of the knife
        under his fingernails, smiling, thinking
        of all the letters he had received
        telling him that
        the way he lived and wrote about
        that--
        it had kept them going when
        all seemed
        truly
        hopeless.

        Rain Or Shine
        the vultures at the zoo
        (all three of them)
        sit very quietly in their
        caged tree
        and below
        on the ground
        are chunks of rotten meat.
        the vultures are over-full.
        our taxes have fed them
        well.
        we move on to the next
        cage.
        a man is in there
        sitting on the ground
        eating
        his own shit.
        i recognize him as
        our former mailman.
        his favorite expression
        had been:
        "have a beautiful day."
        that day i did.
        





        Raw With Love
        little dark girl with
        kind eyes
        when it comes time to
        use the knife
        I won't flinch and
        I won't blame
        you,
        as I drive along the shore alone
        as the palms wave,
        the ugly heavy palms,
        as the living does not arrive
        as the dead do not leave,
        I won't blame you,
        instead
        I will remember the kisses
        our lips raw with love
        and how you gave me
        everything you had
        and how I
        offered you what was left of
        me,
        and I will remember your small room
        the feel of you
        the light in the window
        your records
        your books
        our morning coffee
        our noons our nights
        our bodies spilled together
        sleeping
        the tiny flowing currents
        immediate and forever
        your leg my leg
        your arm my arm
        your smile and the warmth
        of you
        who made me laugh
        again.
        little dark girl with kind eyes
        you have no
        knife. the knife is
        mine and I won't use it
        yet.
        





        Revolt In The Ranks
        I have just spent one-hour-and-a-half
        handicapping tomorrow's
        card.
        when am I going to get at the poems?
        well, they'll just have to wait
        they'll have to warm their feet in the
        anteroom
        where they'll sit gossiping about
        me.
        &quot;this Chinaski, doesn't he realize that
        without us he would have long ago
        gone mad, been dead?&quot;
        &quot;he knows, but he thinks he can keep
        us at his beck and call!&quot;
        &quot;he's an ingrate!&quot;
        &quot;let's give him writer's block!&quot;
        &quot;yeah!&quot;
        &quot;yeah!&quot;
        &quot;yeah!&quot;
        the little poems kick up their heels
        and laugh.
        then the biggest one gets up and
        walks toward the door.
        &quot;hey, where are you going?&quot; he is
        asked.
        &quot;somewhere where I am
        appreciated.&quot;
        then, he
        and the others
        vanish.
        





        Rhyming Poem
        the goldfish sing all night with guitars,
        and the whores go down with the stars,
        the whores go down with the stars
        





        Shoes
        when you're young
        a pair of
        female
        high-heeled shoes
        just sitting
        alone
        in the closet
        can fire your
        bones;
        when you're old
        it's just
        a pair of shoes
        without
        anybody
        in them
        and
        just as
        well.
        





        Short Order
        I took my girlfriend to your last poetry reading,
        she said.
        yes, yes? I asked.
        she's young and pretty, she said.
        and? I asked.
        she hated your
        guts.
        





        Show Biz
        I can't have it
        and you can't have it
        and we won't
        get it
        so don't bet on it
        or even think about
        it
        just get out of bed
        each morning
        wash
        shave
        clothe
        yourself
        and go out into
        it
        because
        outside of that
        all that's left is
        suicide and
        madness
        so you just
        can't
        expect too much
        you can't even
        expect
        so what you do
        is
        work from a modest
        minimal
        base
        like when you
        walk outside
        be glad your car
        might possibly
        be there
        and if it is-
        that the tires
        aren't
        flat
        then you get
        in
        and if it

        starts--you
        start.
        and
        it's the damndest
        movie
        you've ever
        seen
        because
        you're
        in it--
        low budget
        and
        4 billion
        critics
        and the longest
        run
        you ever hope
        for
        is
        one
        day.

        Sleep
        she was a short one
        getting fat and she had once been
        beautiful and
        she drank the wine
        she drank the wine in bed and
        talked and screamed and cursed at
        me
        and i told her
        





        small conversation in the afternoon with John Fante
        he said, "I was working in Hollywood when Faulkner was
        working in Hollywood and he was
        the worst: he was too drunk to stand up at the
        end of the afternoon and so I had to help him
        into a taxi
        day after day after day.
        "but when he left Hollywood, I stayed on, and while I
        didn't drink like that maybe I should have, I might have
        had the guts then to follow him and get the hell out of
        there."
        I told him, "you write as well as
        Faulkner.:
        "you mean that?" he asked from the hospital
        bed, smiling.
        





        So Now?
        the words have come and gone,
        I sit ill.
        the phone rings, the cats sleep.
        Linda vacuums.
        I am waiting to live,
        waiting to die.
        





        Some People
        some people never go crazy.
        me, sometimes I'll lie down behind the couch
        for 3 or 4 days.
        they'll find me there.
        it's Cherub, they'll say, and
        they pour wine down my throat
        rub my chest
        sprinkle me with oils.

        Something For The Touts, The Nuns, The Grocery Clerks, And You . . .
        we have everything and we have nothing
        and some men do it in churches
        and some men do it by tearing butterflies
        in half
        and some men do it in Palm Springs
        laying it into butterblondes
        with Cadillac souls
        Cadillacs and butterflies
        nothing and everything,
        the face melting down to the last puff
        in a cellar in Corpus Christi.
        there's something for the touts, the nuns,
        the grocery clerks and you . . .
        something at 8 a.m., something in the library
        something in the river,
        everything and nothing.
        in the slaughterhouse it comes running along
        the ceiling on a hook, and you swing it --
        one
        two
        three
        and then you've got it, $200 worth of dead
        meat, its bones against your bones
        something and nothing.
        it's always early enough to die and
        it's always too late,
        and the drill of blood in the basin white
        it tells you nothing at all
        and the gravediggers playing poker over
        5 a.m. coffee, waiting for the grass
        to dismiss the frost . . .
        they tell you nothing at all.
        we have everything and we have nothing --
        days with glass edges and the impossible stink
        of river moss -- worse than shit;
        checkerboard days of moves and countermoves,
        fagged interest, with as much sense in defeat as
        in victory; slow days like mules
        humping it slagged and sullen and sun-glazed
        up a road where a madman sits waiting among
        bluejays and wrens netted in and sucked a flakey
        grey.
        good days too of wine and shouting, fights
        in alleys, fat legs of women striving around
        your bowels buried in moans,
        the signs in bullrings like diamonds hollering
        Mother Capri, violets coming out of the ground
        telling you to forget the dead armies and the loves
        that robbed you.
        days when children say funny and brilliant things
        like savages trying to send you a message through

        their bodies while their bodies are still
        alive enough to transmit and feel and run up
        and down without locks and paychecks and
        ideals and possessions and beetle-like
        opinions.
        days when you can cry all day long in
        a green room with the door locked, days
        when you can laugh at the breadman
        because his legs are too long, days
        of looking at hedges . . .
        and nothing, and nothing, the days of
        the bosses, yellow men
        with bad breath and big feet, men
        who look like frogs, hyenas, men who walk
        as if melody had never been invented, men
        who think it is intelligent to hire and fire and
        profit, men with expensive wives they possess
        like 60 acres of ground to be drilled
        or shown-off or to be walled away from
        the incompetent, men who'd kill you
        because they're crazy and justify it because
        it's the law, men who stand in front of
        windows 30 feet wide and see nothing,
        men with luxury yachts who can sail around
        the world and yet never get out of their vest
        pockets, men like snails, men like eels, men
        like slugs, and not as good . . .
        and nothing, getting your last paycheck
        at a harbor, at a factory, at a hospital, at an
        aircraft plant, at a penny arcade, at a
        barbershop, at a job you didn't want
        anyway.
        income tax, sickness, servility, broken
        arms, broken heads -- all the stuffing
        come out like an old pillow.
        we have everything and we have nothing.
        some do it well enough for a while and
        then give way. fame gets them or disgust
        or age or lack of proper diet or ink
        across the eyes or children in college
        or new cars or broken backs while skiing
        in Switzerland or new politics or new wives
        or just natural change and decay --
        the man you knew yesterday hooking
        for ten rounds or drinking for three days and
        three nights by the Sawtooth mountains now
        just something under a sheet or a cross
        or a stone or under an easy delusion,
        or packing a bible or a golf bag or a
        briefcase: how they go, how they go! -- all

        the ones you thought would never go.
        days like this. like your day today.
        maybe the rain on the window trying to
        get through to you. what do you see today?
        what is it? where are you? the best
        days are sometimes the first, sometimes
        the middle and even sometimes the last.
        the vacant lots are not bad, churches in
        Europe on postcards are not bad. people in
        wax museums frozen into their best sterility
        are not bad, horrible but not bad. the
        cannon, think of the cannon, and toast for
        breakfast the coffee hot enough you
        know your tongue is still there, three
        geraniums outside a window, trying to be
        red and trying to be pink and trying to be
        geraniums, no wonder sometimes the women
        cry, no wonder the mules don't want
        to go up the hill. are you in a hotel room
        in Detroit looking for a cigarette? one more
        good day. a little bit of it. and as
        the nurses come out of the building after
        their shift, having had enough, eight nurses
        with different names and different places
        to go -- walking across the lawn, some of them
        want cocoa and a paper, some of them want a
        hot bath, some of them want a man, some
        of them are hardly thinking at all. enough
        and not enough. arcs and pilgrims, oranges
        gutters, ferns, antibodies, boxes of
        tissue paper.
        in the most decent sometimes sun
        there is the softsmoke feeling from urns
        and the canned sound of old battleplanes
        and if you go inside and run your finger
        along the window ledge you'll find
        dirt, maybe even earth.
        and if you look out the window
        there will be the day, and as you
        get older you'll keep looking
        keep looking
        sucking your tongue in a little
        ah ah no no maybe
        some do it naturally
        some obscenely
        everywhere.

        splash
        the illusion is that you are simply
        reading this poem.
        the reality is that this is
        more than a
        poem.
        this is a beggar's knife.
        this is a tulip.
        this is a soldier marching
        through Madrid.
        this is you on your
        death bed.
        this is Li Po laughing
        underground.
        this is not a god-damned
        poem.
        this is a horse asleep.
        a butterfly in
        your brain.
        this is the devil's
        circus.
        you are not reading this
        on a page.
        the page is reading
        you.
        feel it?
        it's like a cobra. it's a hungry eagle circling the room.
        this is not a poem. poems are dull,
        they make you sleep.
        these words force you
        to a new
        madness.
        you have been blessed, you have been pushed into a
        blinding area of
        light.
        the elephant dreams
        with you
        now.
        the curve of space
        bends and
        laughs.
        you can die now.
        you can die now as
        people were meant to
        die:
        great,
        victorious,
        hearing the music,

        being the music,
        roaring,
        roaring,
        roaring.
        





        Sway With Me
        sway with me, everything sad --
        madmen in stone houses
        without doors,
        lepers steaming love and song
        frogs trying to figure
        the sky;
        sway with me, sad things --
        fingers split on a forge
        old age like breakfast shell
        used books, used people
        used flowers, used love
        I need you
        I need you
        I need you:
        it has run away
        like a horse or a dog,
        dead or lost
        or unforgiving.

        The Aliens
        you may not believe it
        but there are people
        who go through life with
        very little
        friction or
        distress.
        they dress well, eat
        well, sleep well.
        they are contented with
        their family
        life.
        they have moments of
        grief
        but all in all
        they are undisturbed
        and often feel
        very good.
        and when they die
        it is an easy
        death, usually in their
        sleep.
        





        The Blackbirds are Rough Today
        lonely as a dry and used orchard
        spread over the earth
        for use and surrender.
        shot down like an ex-pug selling
        dailies on the corner.
        taken by tears like
        an aging chorus girl
        who has gotten her last check.
        a hanky is in order your lord your
        worship.
        the blackbirds are rough today
        like
        ingrown toenails
        in an overnight
        jail---
        wine wine whine,
        the blackbirds run around and
        fly around
        harping about
        Spanish melodies and bones.
        and everywhere is
        nowhere---
        the dream is as bad as
        flapjacks and flat tires:
        why do we go on
        with our minds and
        pockets full of
        dust
        like a bad boy just out of
        school---
        you tell
        me,
        you who were a hero in some
        revolution
        you who teach children
        you who drink with calmness
        you who own large homes
        and walk in gardens
        you who have killed a man and own a
        beautiful wife
        you tell me
        why I am on fire like old dry
        garbage.
        we might surely have some interesting
        correspondence.

        it will keep the mailman busy.
        and the butterflies and ants and bridges and
        cemeteries
        the rocket-makers and dogs and garage mechanics
        will still go on a
        while
        until we run out of stamps
        and/or
        ideas.
        don't be ashamed of
        anything; I guess God meant it all
        like
        locks on
        doors.
        





        the crunch
        too much too little
        too fat
        too thin
        or nobody.
        laughter or
        tears
        haters
        lovers
        strangers with faces like
        the backs of
        thumb tacks
        armies running through
        streets of blood
        waving winebottles
        bayoneting and fucking
        virgins.
        an old guy in a cheap room
        with a photograph of M. Monroe.
        there is a loneliness in this world so great
        that you can see it in the slow movement of
        the hands of a clock
        people so tired
        mutilated
        either by love or no love.
        people just are not good to each other
        one on one.
        the rich are not good to the rich
        the poor are not good to the poor.
        we are afraid.
        our educational system tells us
        that we can all be
        big-ass winners
        it hasn't told us
        about the gutters
        or the suicides.
        or the terror of one person
        aching in one place
        alone

        untouched
        unspoken to
        watering a plant.
        people are not good to each other.
        people are not good to each other.
        people are not good to each other.
        I suppose they never will be.
        I don't ask them to be.
        but sometimes I think about
        it.
        the beads will swing
        the clouds will cloud
        and the killer will behead the child
        like taking a bite out of an ice cream cone.
        too much
        too little
        too fat
        too thin
        or nobody
        more haters than lovers.
        people are not good to each other.
        perhaps if they were
        our deaths would not be so sad.
        meanwhile I look at young girls
        stems
        flowers of chance.
        there must be a way.
        surely there must be a way that we have not yet
        though of.
        who put this brain inside of me?
        it cries
        it demands
        it says that there is a chance.
        it will not say
        "no."


        





        The Genius Of The Crowd
        there is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average
        human being to supply any given army on any given day
        and the best at murder are those who preach against it
        and the best at hate are those who preach love
        and the best at war finally are those who preach peace
        those who preach god, need god
        those who preach peace do not have peace
        those who preach peace do not have love
        beware the preachers
        beware the knowers
        beware those who are always reading books
        beware those who either detest poverty
        or are proud of it
        beware those quick to praise
        for they need praise in return
        beware those who are quick to censor
        they are afraid of what they do not know
        beware those who seek constant crowds for
        they are nothing alone
        beware the average man the average woman
        beware their love, their love is average
        seeks average
        but there is genius in their hatred
        there is enough genius in their hatred to kill you
        to kill anybody
        not wanting solitude
        not understanding solitude
        they will attempt to destroy anything
        that differs from their own
        not being able to create art
        they will not understand art
        they will consider their failure as creators
        only as a failure of the world
        not being able to love fully
        they will believe your love incomplete
        and then they will hate you
        and their hatred will be perfect
        like a shining diamond
        like a knife
        like a mountain
        like a tiger
        like hemlock
        their finest art

        the German hotel
        the German hotel was very strange and expensive and had
        double doors to the rooms, very thick doors, and it over-
        looked the park and the vasser tern and in the mornings
        it was usually too late for breakfast and the maids
        would be everywhere changing sheets and bringing in
        towels, but you never saw any hotel guests, only the
        maids and the desk man and the day desk man was all
        right because we were sober during the day but we had
        trouble with the night man who was some sort of snob
        and not very good with getting the corkscrews and ice
        and wine glasses up to us and he was always phoning to
        say the other guests objected to our noise.
        what other guests?
        I always told him that everything was very quiet,
        nothing was going on, that somebody must be crazy, so
        will you please stop ringing?
        but he kept ringing, he became almost like a
        companion to us through the night.
        but the day man was very nice, he always had little
        messages of importance that either meant money, or a
        good friend coming to see us, or both.
        we stayed at the hotel twice during our trip to
        Europe and each time we checked out the day clerk
        bowed ever so slightly, he was tall and well-dressed
        and pleasant and he said each time: "it was nice to
        have you with us. please come here again if you return."
        "thank you," we said, "thank you."
        it's our favorite hotel and if I ever get rich I am
        going to buy it and fire the night clerk and there will
        be enough ice cubes and corkscrews for everybody.
        





        the great slob
        I was always a natural slob
        I liked to lay upon the bed
        in undershirt (stained, of
        course) (and with cigarette
        holes)
        shoes off
        beerbottle in hand
        trying to shake off a
        difficult night, say with a
        woman still around
        walking the floor
        complaining about this and
        that,
        and I'd work up a
        belch and say, "HEY, YOU DON'T
        LIKE IT? THEN GET YOUR ASS
        OUT OF HERE!"
        I really loved myself, I
        really loved my slob-
        self, and
        they seemed to also:
        always leaving
        but almost
        always
        coming
        back.
        





        The History Of One Tough Motherfucker
        he came to the door one night wet thin beaten and
        terrorized
        a white cross-eyed tailless cat
        I took him in and fed him and he stayed
        grew to trust me until a friend drove up the driveway
        and ran him over
        I took what was left to a vet who said,&quot;not much
        chance...give him these pills...his backbone
        is crushed, but is was crushed before and somehow
        mended, if he lives he'll never walk, look at
        these x-rays, he's been shot, look here, the pellets
        are still there...also, he once had a tail, somebody
        cut it off...&quot;
        





        The House
        They are building a house
        half a block down
        and I sit up here
        with the shades down
        listening to the sounds,
        the hammers pounding in nails,
        thack thack thack thack,
        and then I hear birds,
        and thack thack thack,
        and I go to bed,
        I pull the covers to my throat;
        they have been building this house
        for a month, and soon it will have
        its people...sleeping, eating,
        loving, moving around,
        but somehow
        now
        it is not right,
        there seems a madness,
        men walk on top with nails
        in their mouths
        and I read about Castro and Cuba,
        and at night I walk by
        and the ribs of the house show
        and inside I can see cats walking
        the way cats walk,
        and then a boy rides by on a bicycle
        and still the house is not done
        and in the morning the men
        will be back
        walking around on the house
        with their hammers,
        and it seems people should not build houses
        anymore,
        it seems people should not get married
        anymore,
        it seems people should stop working
        and sit in small rooms
        on 2nd floors
        under electric lights without shades;
        it seems there is a lot to forget
        and a lot not to do,
        and in drugstores, markets, bars,
        the people are tired, they do not want
        to move, and I stand there at night
        and look through this house and the
        house does not want to be built;
        through its sides I can see the purple hills
        and the first lights of evening,
        and it is cold
        and I button my coat
        and I stand there looking through the house

        and the cats stop and look at me
        until I am embarrased
        and move North up the sidewalk
        where I will buy
        cigarettes and beer
        and return to my room.
        





        The Icecream People
        the lady has me temporarily off the bottle
        and now the pecker stands up
        better.
        however, things change overnight--
        instead of listening to Shostakovich and
        Mozart through a smeared haze of smoke
        the nights change, new
        complexities:
        we drive to Baskin-Robbins,
        31 flavors:
        Rocky Road, Bubble Gum, Apricot Ice, Strawberry
        Cheesecake, Chocolate Mint...
        we park outside and look at icecream
        people
        a very healthy and satisfied people,
        nary a potential suicide in sight
        (they probably even vote)
        and I tell her
        "what if the boys saw me go in there? suppose they
        find out I'm going in for a walnut peach sundae?"
        "come on, chicken," she laughs and we go in
        and stand with the icecream people.
        none of them are cursing or threatening
        the clerks.
        there seem to be no hangovers or
        grievances.
        I am alarmed at the placid and calm wave
        that flows about. I feel like a leper in a
        beauty contest. we finally get our sundaes and
        sit in the car and eat them.
        I must admit they are quite good. a curious new
        world. (all my friends tell me I am looking
        better. "you're looking good, man, we thought you
        were going to die there for a while...")
        --those 4,500 dark nights, the jails, the
        hospitals...
        and later that night
        there is use for the pecker, use for
        love, and it is glorious,
        long and true,
        and afterwards we speak of easy things;
        our heads by the open window with the moonlight
        looking through, we sleep in each other's
        arms.
        the icecream people make me feel good,
        inside and out.

        the lucky ones
        stuck in the rain on the freeway, 6:15 p.m.,
        these are the lucky ones, these are the
        dutifully employed, most with their radios on as loud
        as possible as they try not to think or remember.
        this is our new civilization: as men
        once lived in trees and caves now they live
        in their automobiles and on freeways as
        the local news is heard again and again while
        we shift from first gear to second and back to first.
        there's a poor fellow stalled in the fast lane ahead, hood
        up, he's standing against the freeway fence
        a newspaper over his head in the rain.
        the other cars force their way around his car, pull out into
        the next lane in front of cars determined to shut them off.
        in the lane to my right a driver is being followed by a
        police car with blinking red and blue lights - he surely
        can't be <i>speeding</i> as
        suddenly the rain comes down in a giant wash and all the
        cars stop and
        even with the windows up I can smell somebody's clutch
        burning.
        I just hope it's not mine as
        the wall of water diminishes and we go back into first
        gear; we are all still
        a long way from home as I memorize
        the silhouette of the car in front of me and the shape of the
        driver's head or
        what
        I can see of it above the headrest while
        his bumper sticker asks me
        HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR KID TODAY?
        suddenly I have an urge to scream
        as another wall of water comes down and the
        man on the radio announces that there will be a 70 percent
        chance of showers tomorrow night
        





        The Meek Shall Inherit The Earth
        if I suffer at this
        typewriter
        think how I'd feel
        among the lettuce-
        pickers of Salinas?

        The Sun Weilds Mercy
        and the sun weilds mercy

        and rockets leap like toads,
        and the boys get out the maps
        and pin-cuishon the moon,
        old green cheese,
        no life there but too much on earth:
        our unwashed India boys
        crosssing their legs,playing pipes,
        starving with sucked in bellies,
        watching the snakes volute
        like beautiful women in the hungry air;
        the rockets leap,
        the rockets leap like hares,
        clearing clump and dog
        replacing out-dated bullets;
        the Chineses still carve
        in jade,quietly stuffing rice
        into their hunger, a hunger
        a thousand years old,
        their muddy rivers moving with fire
        and song, barges, houseboats
        pushed by drifting poles
        of waiting without wanting;
        in Turkey they face the East
        on their carpets
        praying to a purple god
        who smokes and laughs
        and sticks fingers in their eyes
        blinding them, as gods will do;
        but the rockets are ready: peace is no longer,
        for some reason,precious;
        madness drifts like lily pads
        on a pond circling senselessly;
        the painters paint dipping
        their reds and greens and yellows,

        scrabbling in pits over bits

        of helmet, instrument and glass;

        lovers lie entwined and lost
        and sick as peace;

        flowers open as they always have
        opened but covered with thin dust
        of rocket fuel and mushrooms,
        poison mushrooms; it's a bad time,

        leaders, by poets , doctors, comedians,
        by manufacturers of soup
        and biscuits, Janus-faced hucksters
        of their own indexerity;
        I can now see now the coal-slick
        contanminated fields, a snail or 2,
        bile, obsidian, a fish or 3
        in the shallows, an obloquy of our
        source and our sight.....
        has this happend before? is history
        a circle that catches itself by the tail,
        a dream, a nightmare,

        These Things
        these things that we support most well
        have nothing to do with up,
        and we do with them
        out of boredom or fear or money
        or cracked intelligence;
        our circle and our candle of light
        being small,
        so small we cannot bear it,
        we heave out with Idea
        and lose the Center:
        all wax without the wick,
        and we see names that once meant
        wisdom,
        like signs into ghost towns,
        and only the graves are real.

        This
        self-congratulatory nonsense as the
        





        Three Oranges
        first time my father overheard me listening to
        this bit of music he asked me,
        &quot;what is it?&quot;
        &quot;it's called Love For Three Oranges,&quot;
        I informed him.
        &quot;boy,&quot; he said, &quot;that's getting it
        cheap.&quot;
        he meant sex.
        listening to it
        I always imagined three oranges
        sitting there,
        you know how orange they can
        get,
        so mightily orange.
        maybe Prokofiev had meant
        what my father
        thought.
        if so, I preferred it the
        other way
        the most horrible thing
        I could think of
        was part of me being
        what ejaculated out of the
        end of his
        stupid penis.
        I will never forgive him
        for that,
        his trick that I am stuck
        with,
        I find no nobility in
        parenthood.
        I say kill the Father
        before he makes more
        such as
        I.

        are you trying to crush me out like the rest of them?
        why didn't you take my money? they usually do
        from the sleeping drunken pants sick in the corner.
        next time take my left arm or a fifty
        but not my poems:
        I'm not Shakespeare
        but sometime simply
        there won't be any more, abstract or otherwise;
        there'll always be mony and whores and drunkards
        down to the last bomb,
        but as God said,
        crossing his legs,
        I see where I have made plenty of poets
        but not so very much
        poetry.
        





        Trapped
        don't undress my love
        you might find a mannequin:
        don't undress the mannequin
        you might find
        my love.

        True
        one of Lorca's best lines
        is,
        &quot;agony, always
        agony ...&quot;
        





        True Story
        they found him walking along the freeway
        all red in
        front
        he had taken a rusty tin can
        and cut off his sexual
        machinery
        as if to say --
        see what you've done to
        me? you might as well have the
        rest.
        and he put part of him
        in one pocket and
        part of him in
        another
        and that's how they found him,
        walking
        along.
        they gave him over to the
        doctors
        who tried to sew the parts
        back
        on
        but the parts were
        quite contented
        the way they
        were.
        I think sometimes of all of the good
        ass
        turned over to the
        monsters of the
        world.
        maybe it was his protest against
        this or
        his protest
        against
        everything.
        a one man
        Freedom March
        that never squeezed in
        between
        the concert reviews and the
        baseball
        scores.
        God, or somebody,
        bless
        him.

        What A Writer
        what i liked about e.e. cummings
        was that he cut away from
        the holiness of the
        word
        and with charm
        and gamble
        gave us lines
        that sliced through the
        dung.
        how it was needed!
        how we were withering
        away
        in the old
        tired
        manner.
        of course, then came all
        the e.e. cummings
        copyists.
        they copied him then
        as the others had
        copied Keats, Shelly,
        Swinburne, Byron, et
        al.
        but there was only
        one
        e.e. cummings.
        of course.
        one sun.
        one moon.
        





        What Can We Do?
        at their best, there is gentleness in Humanity.
        some understanding and, at times, acts of
        courage
        but all in all it is a mass, a glob that doesn't
        have too much.
        it is like a large animal deep in sleep and
        almost nothing can awaken it.
        when activated it's best at brutality,
        selfishness, unjust judgments, murder.
        





        Whats The Use Of A Title?
        They don't make it
        the beautiful die in flame-
        suicide pills, rat poison, rope what-
        ever...
        they rip their arms off,
        throw themselves out of windows,
        they pull their eyes out of the sockets,
        reject love
        reject hate
        reject, reject.
        they don't make it
        the beautiful can't endure,
        they are butterflies
        they are doves
        they are sparrows,
        they don't make it.
        one tall shot of flame
        while the old men play checkers in the park
        one flame, one good flame
        while the old men play checkers in the park
        in the sun.
        the beautiful are found in the edge of a room
        crumpled into spiders and needles and silence
        and we can never understand why they
        left, they were so
        beautiful.
        they don't make it,
        the beautiful die young
        and leave the ugly to their ugly lives.
        lovely and brilliant: life and suicide and death
        as the old men play checkers in the sun
        in the park.

        Young in New Orleans
        starving there, sitting around the bars,
        and at night walking the streets for
        hours,
        the moonlight always seemed fake
        to me, maybe it was,
        and in the French Quarter I watched
        the horses and buggies going by,
        everybody sitting high in the open
        carriages, the black driver, and in
        back the man and the woman,
        usually young and always white.
        and I was always white.
        and hardly charmed by the
        world.
        New Orleans was a place to
        hide.
        I could piss away my life,
        unmolested.
        except for the rats.
        the rats in my dark small room
        very much resented sharing it
        with me.
        they were large and fearless
        and stared at me with eyes
        that spoke
        an unblinking
        death.
        women were beyond me.
        they saw something
        depraved.
        there was one waitress
        a little older than
        I, she rather smiled,
        lingered when she
        brought my
        coffee.
        that was plenty for
        me, that was
        enough.
        there was something about
        that city, though
        it didn't let me feel guilty
        that I had no feeling for the
        things so many others
        needed.
        it let me alone.
        sitting up in my bed
        the llights out,

        hearing the outside
        sounds,
        lifting my cheap
        bottle of wine,
        letting the warmth of
        the grape
        enter
        me
        as I heard the rats
        moving about the
        room,
        I preferred them
        to
        humans.
        being lost,
        being crazy maybe
        is not so bad
        if you can be
        that way
        undisturbed.
        New Orleans gave me
        that.
        nobody ever called
        my name.
        no telephone,
        no car,
        no job,
        no
        anything.
        me and the
        rats
        and my youth,
        one time,
        that time
        I knew
        even through the
        nothingness,
        it was a
        celebration
        of something not to
        do
        but only
        know.
        







There came a day - at Summer's full -
Entirely for me -
I thought that such were for the Saints -
Where Resurrections - be -

The sun - as common - went abroad -
The flowers - accustomed - blew,
As if no soul - that solstice passed -
Which maketh all things - new -

The time was scarce profaned - by speech -
The falling of a word
Was needless - as at Sacrament -
The _Wardrobe_ - of our Lord!

Each was to each - the sealed church -
Permitted to commune -  _this_ time -
Lest we too awkward show
At Supper of "the Lamb."

The hours slid fast - as hours will -
Clutched tight - by greedy hands -
So - faces on two Decks look back -
Bound to _opposing_ lands.

And so, when all the time had leaked,
Without external sound,
Each bound the other's Crucifix -
We gave no other bond -

Sufficient troth - that we shall _rise_,
Deposed - at length the Grave -
To that new marriage -
_Justified_ - through Calvaries - of Love!

    This is my letter to the world,
       That never wrote to me, --
    The simple news that Nature told,
       With tender majesty.

    Her message is committed
       To hands I cannot see;
    For love of her, sweet countrymen,
       Judge tenderly of me!










I. LIFE.


I.

SUCCESS.

[Published in "A Masque of Poets"
at the request of "H.H.," the author's
fellow-townswoman and friend.]

Success is counted sweetest
By those who ne'er succeed.
To comprehend a nectar
Requires sorest need.

Not one of all the purple host
Who took the flag to-day
Can tell the definition,
So clear, of victory,

As he, defeated, dying,
On whose forbidden ear
The distant strains of triumph
Break, agonized and clear!





II.

Our share of night to bear,
Our share of morning,
Our blank in bliss to fill,
Our blank in scorning.

Here a star, and there a star,
Some lose their way.
Here a mist, and there a mist,
Afterwards -- day!





III.

ROUGE ET NOIR.

Soul, wilt thou toss again?
By just such a hazard
Hundreds have lost, indeed,
But tens have won an all.

Angels' breathless ballot
Lingers to record thee;
Imps in eager caucus
Raffle for my soul.





IV.

ROUGE GAGNE.

'T is so much joy! 'T is so much joy!
If I should fail, what poverty!
And yet, as poor as I
Have ventured all upon a throw;
Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so
This side the victory!

Life is but life, and death but death!
Bliss is but bliss, and breath but breath!
And if, indeed, I fail,
At least to know the worst is sweet.
Defeat means nothing but defeat,
No drearier can prevail!

And if I gain, -- oh, gun at sea,
Oh, bells that in the steeples be,
At first repeat it slow!
For heaven is a different thing
Conjectured, and waked sudden in,
And might o'erwhelm me so!





V.

Glee! The great storm is over!
Four have recovered the land;
Forty gone down together
Into the boiling sand.

Ring, for the scant salvation!
Toll, for the bonnie souls, --
Neighbor and friend and bridegroom,
Spinning upon the shoals!

How they will tell the shipwreck
When winter shakes the door,
Till the children ask, "But the forty?
Did they come back no more?"

Then a silence suffuses the story,
And a softness the teller's eye;
And the children no further question,
And only the waves reply.





VI.

If I can stop one heart from breaking,
I shall not live in vain;
If I can ease one life the aching,
Or cool one pain,
Or help one fainting robin
Unto his nest again,
I shall not live in vain.





VII.

ALMOST!

Within my reach!
I could have touched!
I might have chanced that way!
Soft sauntered through the village,
Sauntered as soft away!
So unsuspected violets
Within the fields lie low,
Too late for striving fingers
That passed, an hour ago.





VIII.

A wounded deer leaps highest,
I've heard the hunter tell;
'T is but the ecstasy of death,
And then the brake is still.

The smitten rock that gushes,
The trampled steel that springs;
A cheek is always redder
Just where the hectic stings!

Mirth is the mail of anguish,
In which it cautions arm,
Lest anybody spy the blood
And "You're hurt" exclaim!





IX.

The heart asks pleasure first,
And then, excuse from pain;
And then, those little anodynes
That deaden suffering;

And then, to go to sleep;
And then, if it should be
The will of its Inquisitor,
The liberty to die.





X.

IN A LIBRARY.

A precious, mouldering pleasure 't is
To meet an antique book,
In just the dress his century wore;
A privilege, I think,

His venerable hand to take,
And warming in our own,
A passage back, or two, to make
To times when he was young.

His quaint opinions to inspect,
His knowledge to unfold
On what concerns our mutual mind,
The literature of old;

What interested scholars most,
What competitions ran
When Plato was a certainty.
And Sophocles a man;

When Sappho was a living girl,
And Beatrice wore
The gown that Dante deified.
Facts, centuries before,

He traverses familiar,
As one should come to town
And tell you all your dreams were true;
He lived where dreams were sown.

His presence is enchantment,
You beg him not to go;
Old volumes shake their vellum heads
And tantalize, just so.





XI.

Much madness is divinest sense
To a discerning eye;
Much sense the starkest madness.
'T is the majority
In this, as all, prevails.
Assent, and you are sane;
Demur, -- you're straightway dangerous,
And handled with a chain.
XII.

I asked no other thing,
No other was denied.
I offered Being for it;
The mighty merchant smiled.

Brazil? He twirled a button,
Without a glance my way:
"But, madam, is there nothing else
That we can show to-day?"





XIII.

EXCLUSION.

The soul selects her own society,
Then shuts the door;
On her divine majority
Obtrude no more.

Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing
At her low gate;
Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
Upon her mat.

I've known her from an ample nation
Choose one;
Then close the valves of her attention
Like stone.





XIV.

THE SECRET.

Some things that fly there be, --
Birds, hours, the bumble-bee:
Of these no elegy.

Some things that stay there be, --
Grief, hills, eternity:
Nor this behooveth me.

There are, that resting, rise.
Can I expound the skies?
How still the riddle lies!





XV.

THE LONELY HOUSE.

I know some lonely houses off the road
A robber 'd like the look of, --
Wooden barred,
And windows hanging low,
Inviting to
A portico,
Where two could creep:
One hand the tools,
The other peep
To make sure all's asleep.
Old-fashioned eyes,
Not easy to surprise!

How orderly the kitchen 'd look by night,
With just a clock, --
But they could gag the tick,
And mice won't bark;
And so the walls don't tell,
None will.

A pair of spectacles ajar just stir --
An almanac's aware.
Was it the mat winked,
Or a nervous star?
The moon slides down the stair
To see who's there.

There's plunder, -- where?
Tankard, or spoon,
Earring, or stone,
A watch, some ancient brooch
To match the grandmamma,
Staid sleeping there.

Day rattles, too,
Stealth's slow;
The sun has got as far
As the third sycamore.
Screams chanticleer,
"Who's there?"
And echoes, trains away,
Sneer -- "Where?"
While the old couple, just astir,
Fancy the sunrise left the door ajar!





XVI.

To fight aloud is very brave,
But gallanter, I know,
Who charge within the bosom,
The cavalry of woe.

Who win, and nations do not see,
Who fall, and none observe,
Whose dying eyes no country
Regards with patriot love.

We trust, in plumed procession,
For such the angels go,
Rank after rank, with even feet
And uniforms of snow.





XVII.

DAWN.

When night is almost done,
And sunrise grows so near
That we can touch the spaces,
It 's time to smooth the hair

And get the dimples ready,
And wonder we could care
For that old faded midnight
That frightened but an hour.





XVIII.

THE BOOK OF MARTYRS.

Read, sweet, how others strove,
Till we are stouter;
What they renounced,
Till we are less afraid;
How many times they bore
The faithful witness,
Till we are helped,
As if a kingdom cared!

Read then of faith
That shone above the fagot;
Clear strains of hymn
The river could not drown;
Brave names of men
And celestial women,
Passed out of record
Into renown!





XIX.

THE MYSTERY OF PAIN.

Pain has an element of blank;
It cannot recollect
When it began, or if there were
A day when it was not.

It has no future but itself,
Its infinite realms contain
Its past, enlightened to perceive
New periods of pain.





XX.

I taste a liquor never brewed,
From tankards scooped in pearl;
Not all the vats upon the Rhine
Yield such an alcohol!

Inebriate of air am I,
And debauchee of dew,
Reeling, through endless summer days,
From inns of molten blue.

When landlords turn the drunken bee
Out of the foxglove's door,
When butterflies renounce their drams,
I shall but drink the more!

Till seraphs swing their snowy hats,
And saints to windows run,
To see the little tippler
Leaning against the sun!





XXI.

A BOOK.

He ate and drank the precious words,
His spirit grew robust;
He knew no more that he was poor,
Nor that his frame was dust.
He danced along the dingy days,
And this bequest of wings
Was but a book. What liberty
A loosened spirit brings!





XXII.

I had no time to hate, because
The grave would hinder me,
And life was not so ample I
Could finish enmity.

Nor had I time to love; but since
Some industry must be,
The little toil of love, I thought,
Was large enough for me.





XXIII.

UNRETURNING.

'T was such a little, little boat
That toddled down the bay!
'T was such a gallant, gallant sea
That beckoned it away!

'T was such a greedy, greedy wave
That licked it from the coast;
Nor ever guessed the stately sails
My little craft was lost!





XXIV.

Whether my bark went down at sea,
Whether she met with gales,
Whether to isles enchanted
She bent her docile sails;

By what mystic mooring
She is held to-day, --
This is the errand of the eye
Out upon the bay.





XXV.

Belshazzar had a letter, --
He never had but one;
Belshazzar's correspondent
Concluded and begun
In that immortal copy
The conscience of us all
Can read without its glasses
On revelation's wall.





XXVI.

The brain within its groove
Runs evenly and true;
But let a splinter swerve,
'T were easier for you
To put the water back
When floods have slit the hills,
And scooped a turnpike for themselves,
And blotted out the mills!






II. LOVE.


I.

MINE.

Mine by the right of the white election!
Mine by the royal seal!
Mine by the sign in the scarlet prison
Bars cannot conceal!

Mine, here in vision and in veto!
Mine, by the grave's repeal
Titled, confirmed, -- delirious charter!
Mine, while the ages steal!





II.

BEQUEST.

You left me, sweet, two legacies, --
A legacy of love
A Heavenly Father would content,
Had He the offer of;

You left me boundaries of pain
Capacious as the sea,
Between eternity and time,
Your consciousness and me.





III.

Alter? When the hills do.
Falter? When the sun
Question if his glory
Be the perfect one.

Surfeit? When the daffodil
Doth of the dew:
Even as herself, O friend!
I will of you!





IV.

SUSPENSE.

Elysium is as far as to
The very nearest room,
If in that room a friend await
Felicity or doom.

What fortitude the soul contains,
That it can so endure
The accent of a coming foot,
The opening of a door!





V.

SURRENDER.

Doubt me, my dim companion!
Why, God would be content
With but a fraction of the love
Poured thee without a stint.
The whole of me, forever,
What more the woman can, --
Say quick, that I may dower thee
With last delight I own!

It cannot be my spirit,
For that was thine before;
I ceded all of dust I knew, --
What opulence the more
Had I, a humble maiden,
Whose farthest of degree
Was that she might,
Some distant heaven,
Dwell timidly with thee!





VI.

If you were coming in the fall,
I'd brush the summer by
With half a smile and half a spurn,
As housewives do a fly.

If I could see you in a year,
I'd wind the months in balls,
And put them each in separate drawers,
Until their time befalls.

If only centuries delayed,
I'd count them on my hand,
Subtracting till my fingers dropped
Into Van Diemen's land.

If certain, when this life was out,
That yours and mine should be,
I'd toss it yonder like a rind,
And taste eternity.

But now, all ignorant of the length
Of time's uncertain wing,
It goads me, like the goblin bee,
That will not state its sting.





VII.

WITH A FLOWER.

I hide myself within my flower,
That wearing on your breast,
You, unsuspecting, wear me too --
And angels know the rest.

I hide myself within my flower,
That, fading from your vase,
You, unsuspecting, feel for me
Almost a loneliness.





VIII.

PROOF.

That I did always love,
I bring thee proof:
That till I loved
I did not love enough.

That I shall love alway,
I offer thee
That love is life,
And life hath immortality.

This, dost thou doubt, sweet?
Then have I
Nothing to show
But Calvary.





IX.

Have you got a brook in your little heart,
Where bashful flowers blow,
And blushing birds go down to drink,
And shadows tremble so?

And nobody knows, so still it flows,
That any brook is there;
And yet your little draught of life
Is daily drunken there.

Then look out for the little brook in March,
When the rivers overflow,
And the snows come hurrying from the hills,
And the bridges often go.

And later, in August it may be,
When the meadows parching lie,
Beware, lest this little brook of life
Some burning noon go dry!





X.

TRANSPLANTED.

As if some little Arctic flower,
Upon the polar hem,
Went wandering down the latitudes,
Until it puzzled came
To continents of summer,
To firmaments of sun,
To strange, bright crowds of flowers,
And birds of foreign tongue!
I say, as if this little flower
To Eden wandered in --
What then? Why, nothing, only,
Your inference therefrom!





XI.

THE OUTLET.

My river runs to thee:
Blue sea, wilt welcome me?

My river waits reply.
Oh sea, look graciously!

I'll fetch thee brooks
From spotted nooks, --

Say, sea,
Take me!





XII.

IN VAIN.

I cannot live with you,
It would be life,
And life is over there
Behind the shelf

The sexton keeps the key to,
Putting up
Our life, his porcelain,
Like a cup

Discarded of the housewife,
Quaint or broken;
A newer Sevres pleases,
Old ones crack.

I could not die with you,
For one must wait
To shut the other's gaze down, --
You could not.

And I, could I stand by
And see you freeze,
Without my right of frost,
Death's privilege?

Nor could I rise with you,
Because your face
Would put out Jesus',
That new grace

Glow plain and foreign
On my homesick eye,
Except that you, than he
Shone closer by.

They'd judge us -- how?
For you served Heaven, you know,
Or sought to;
I could not,

Because you saturated sight,
And I had no more eyes
For sordid excellence
As Paradise.

And were you lost, I would be,
Though my name
Rang loudest
On the heavenly fame.

And were you saved,
And I condemned to be
Where you were not,
That self were hell to me.

So we must keep apart,
You there, I here,
With just the door ajar
That oceans are,
And prayer,
And that pale sustenance,
Despair!





XIII.

RENUNCIATION.

There came a day at summer's full
Entirely for me;
I thought that such were for the saints,
Where revelations be.

The sun, as common, went abroad,
The flowers, accustomed, blew,
As if no soul the solstice passed
That maketh all things new.

The time was scarce profaned by speech;
The symbol of a word
Was needless, as at sacrament
The wardrobe of our Lord.

Each was to each the sealed church,
Permitted to commune this time,
Lest we too awkward show
At supper of the Lamb.

The hours slid fast, as hours will,
Clutched tight by greedy hands;
So faces on two decks look back,
Bound to opposing lands.

And so, when all the time had failed,
Without external sound,
Each bound the other's crucifix,
We gave no other bond.

Sufficient troth that we shall rise --
Deposed, at length, the grave --
To that new marriage, justified
Through Calvaries of Love!





XIV.

LOVE'S BAPTISM.

I'm ceded, I've stopped being theirs;
The name they dropped upon my face
With water, in the country church,
Is finished using now,
And they can put it with my dolls,
My childhood, and the string of spools
I've finished threading too.

Baptized before without the choice,
But this time consciously, of grace
Unto supremest name,
Called to my full, the crescent dropped,
Existence's whole arc filled up
With one small diadem.

My second rank, too small the first,
Crowned, crowing on my father's breast,
A half unconscious queen;
But this time, adequate, erect,
With will to choose or to reject.
And I choose -- just a throne.





XV.

RESURRECTION.

'T was a long parting, but the time
For interview had come;
Before the judgment-seat of God,
The last and second time

These fleshless lovers met,
A heaven in a gaze,
A heaven of heavens, the privilege
Of one another's eyes.

No lifetime set on them,
Apparelled as the new
Unborn, except they had beheld,
Born everlasting now.

Was bridal e'er like this?
A paradise, the host,
And cherubim and seraphim
The most familiar guest.





XVI.

APOCALYPSE.

I'm wife; I've finished that,
That other state;
I'm Czar, I'm woman now:
It's safer so.

How odd the girl's life looks
Behind this soft eclipse!
I think that earth seems so
To those in heaven now.

This being comfort, then
That other kind was pain;
But why compare?
I'm wife! stop there!





XVII.

THE WIFE.

She rose to his requirement, dropped
The playthings of her life
To take the honorable work
Of woman and of wife.

If aught she missed in her new day
Of amplitude, or awe,
Or first prospective, or the gold
In using wore away,

It lay unmentioned, as the sea
Develops pearl and weed,
But only to himself is known
The fathoms they abide.





XVIII.

APOTHEOSIS.

Come slowly, Eden!
Lips unused to thee,
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,

Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars -- enters,
And is lost in balms!











III. NATURE.

I.

New feet within my garden go,
New fingers stir the sod;
A troubadour upon the elm
Betrays the solitude.

New children play upon the green,
New weary sleep below;
And still the pensive spring returns,
And still the punctual snow!





II.

MAY-FLOWER.

Pink, small, and punctual,
Aromatic, low,
Covert in April,
Candid in May,

Dear to the moss,
Known by the knoll,
Next to the robin
In every human soul.

Bold little beauty,
Bedecked with thee,
Nature forswears
Antiquity.





III.

WHY?

The murmur of a bee
A witchcraft yieldeth me.
If any ask me why,
'T were easier to die
Than tell.

The red upon the hill
Taketh away my will;
If anybody sneer,
Take care, for God is here,
That's all.

The breaking of the day
Addeth to my degree;
If any ask me how,
Artist, who drew me so,
Must tell!





IV.

Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower?
But I could never sell.
If you would like to borrow
Until the daffodil

Unties her yellow bonnet
Beneath the village door,
Until the bees, from clover rows
Their hock and sherry draw,

Why, I will lend until just then,
But not an hour more!





V.

The pedigree of honey
Does not concern the bee;
A clover, any time, to him
Is aristocracy.





VI.

A SERVICE OF SONG.

Some keep the Sabbath going to church;
I keep it staying at home,
With a bobolink for a chorister,
And an orchard for a dome.

Some keep the Sabbath in surplice;
I just wear my wings,
And instead of tolling the bell for church,
Our little sexton sings.

God preaches, -- a noted clergyman, --
And the sermon is never long;
So instead of getting to heaven at last,
I'm going all along!





VII.

The bee is not afraid of me,
I know the butterfly;
The pretty people in the woods
Receive me cordially.

The brooks laugh louder when I come,
The breezes madder play.
Wherefore, mine eyes, thy silver mists?
Wherefore, O summer's day?





VIII.

SUMMER'S ARMIES.

Some rainbow coming from the fair!
Some vision of the world Cashmere
I confidently see!
Or else a peacock's purple train,
Feather by feather, on the plain
Fritters itself away!

The dreamy butterflies bestir,
Lethargic pools resume the whir
Of last year's sundered tune.
From some old fortress on the sun
Baronial bees march, one by one,
In murmuring platoon!

The robins stand as thick to-day
As flakes of snow stood yesterday,
On fence and roof and twig.
The orchis binds her feather on
For her old lover, Don the Sun,
Revisiting the bog!

Without commander, countless, still,
The regiment of wood and hill
In bright detachment stand.
Behold! Whose multitudes are these?
The children of whose turbaned seas,
Or what Circassian land?





IX.

THE GRASS.

The grass so little has to do, --
A sphere of simple green,
With only butterflies to brood,
And bees to entertain,

And stir all day to pretty tunes
The breezes fetch along,
And hold the sunshine in its lap
And bow to everything;

And thread the dews all night, like pearls,
And make itself so fine, --
A duchess were too common
For such a noticing.

And even when it dies, to pass
In odors so divine,
As lowly spices gone to sleep,
Or amulets of pine.

And then to dwell in sovereign barns,
And dream the days away, --
The grass so little has to do,
I wish I were the hay!





X.

A little road not made of man,
Enabled of the eye,
Accessible to thill of bee,
Or cart of butterfly.

If town it have, beyond itself,
'T is that I cannot say;
I only sigh, -- no vehicle
Bears me along that way.





XI.

SUMMER SHOWER.

A drop fell on the apple tree,
Another on the roof;
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,
And made the gables laugh.

A few went out to help the brook,
That went to help the sea.
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,
What necklaces could be!

The dust replaced in hoisted roads,
The birds jocoser sung;
The sunshine threw his hat away,
The orchards spangles hung.

The breezes brought dejected lutes,
And bathed them in the glee;
The East put out a single flag,
And signed the fete away.





XII.

PSALM OF THE DAY.

A something in a summer's day,
As slow her flambeaux burn away,
Which solemnizes me.

A something in a summer's noon, --
An azure depth, a wordless tune,
Transcending ecstasy.

And still within a summer's night
A something so transporting bright,
I clap my hands to see;

Then veil my too inspecting face,
Lest such a subtle, shimmering grace
Flutter too far for me.

The wizard-fingers never rest,
The purple brook within the breast
Still chafes its narrow bed;

Still rears the East her amber flag,
Guides still the sun along the crag
His caravan of red,

Like flowers that heard the tale of dews,
But never deemed the dripping prize
Awaited their low brows;

Or bees, that thought the summer's name
Some rumor of delirium
No summer could for them;

Or Arctic creature, dimly stirred
By tropic hint, -- some travelled bird
Imported to the wood;

Or wind's bright signal to the ear,
Making that homely and severe,
Contented, known, before

The heaven unexpected came,
To lives that thought their worshipping
A too presumptuous psalm.





XIII.

THE SEA OF SUNSET.

This is the land the sunset washes,
These are the banks of the Yellow Sea;
Where it rose, or whither it rushes,
These are the western mystery!

Night after night her purple traffic
Strews the landing with opal bales;
Merchantmen poise upon horizons,
Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.





XIV.

PURPLE CLOVER.

There is a flower that bees prefer,
And butterflies desire;
To gain the purple democrat
The humming-birds aspire.

And whatsoever insect pass,
A honey bears away
Proportioned to his several dearth
And her capacity.

Her face is rounder than the moon,
And ruddier than the gown
Of orchis in the pasture,
Or rhododendron worn.

She doth not wait for June;
Before the world is green
Her sturdy little countenance
Against the wind is seen,

Contending with the grass,
Near kinsman to herself,
For privilege of sod and sun,
Sweet litigants for life.

And when the hills are full,
And newer fashions blow,
Doth not retract a single spice
For pang of jealousy.

Her public is the noon,
Her providence the sun,
Her progress by the bee proclaimed
In sovereign, swerveless tune.

The bravest of the host,
Surrendering the last,
Nor even of defeat aware
When cancelled by the frost.





XV.

THE BEE.

Like trains of cars on tracks of plush
I hear the level bee:
A jar across the flowers goes,
Their velvet masonry

Withstands until the sweet assault
Their chivalry consumes,
While he, victorious, tilts away
To vanquish other blooms.

His feet are shod with gauze,
His helmet is of gold;
His breast, a single onyx
With chrysoprase, inlaid.

His labor is a chant,
His idleness a tune;
Oh, for a bee's experience
Of clovers and of noon!





XVI.

Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn
Indicative that suns go down;
The notice to the startled grass
That darkness is about to pass.





XVII.

As children bid the guest good-night,
And then reluctant turn,
My flowers raise their pretty lips,
Then put their nightgowns on.

As children caper when they wake,
Merry that it is morn,
My flowers from a hundred cribs
Will peep, and prance again.





XVIII.

Angels in the early morning
May be seen the dews among,
Stooping, plucking, smiling, flying:
Do the buds to them belong?

Angels when the sun is hottest
May be seen the sands among,
Stooping, plucking, sighing, flying;
Parched the flowers they bear along.





XIX.

So bashful when I spied her,
So pretty, so ashamed!
So hidden in her leaflets,
Lest anybody find;

So breathless till I passed her,
So helpless when I turned
And bore her, struggling, blushing,
Her simple haunts beyond!

For whom I robbed the dingle,
For whom betrayed the dell,
Many will doubtless ask me,
But I shall never tell!





XX.

TWO WORLDS.

It makes no difference abroad,
The seasons fit the same,
The mornings blossom into noons,
And split their pods of flame.

Wild-flowers kindle in the woods,
The brooks brag all the day;
No blackbird bates his jargoning
For passing Calvary.

Auto-da-fe and judgment
Are nothing to the bee;
His separation from his rose
To him seems misery.





XXI.

THE MOUNTAIN.

The mountain sat upon the plain
In his eternal chair,
His observation omnifold,
His inquest everywhere.

The seasons prayed around his knees,
Like children round a sire:
Grandfather of the days is he,
Of dawn the ancestor.





XXII.

A DAY.

I'll tell you how the sun rose, --
A ribbon at a time.
The steeples swam in amethyst,
The news like squirrels ran.

The hills untied their bonnets,
The bobolinks begun.
Then I said softly to myself,
"That must have been the sun!"

        *  *  *

But how he set, I know not.
There seemed a purple stile
Which little yellow boys and girls
Were climbing all the while

Till when they reached the other side,
A dominie in gray
Put gently up the evening bars,
And led the flock away.





XXIII.

The butterfly's assumption-gown,
In chrysoprase apartments hung,
  This afternoon put on.

How condescending to descend,
And be of buttercups the friend
  In a New England town!





XXIV.

THE WIND.

Of all the sounds despatched abroad,
There's not a charge to me
Like that old measure in the boughs,
That phraseless melody

The wind does, working like a hand
Whose fingers brush the sky,
Then quiver down, with tufts of tune
Permitted gods and me.

When winds go round and round in bands,
And thrum upon the door,
And birds take places overhead,
To bear them orchestra,

I crave him grace, of summer boughs,
If such an outcast be,
He never heard that fleshless chant
Rise solemn in the tree,

As if some caravan of sound
On deserts, in the sky,
Had broken rank,
Then knit, and passed
In seamless company.





XXV.

DEATH AND LIFE.

Apparently with no surprise
To any happy flower,
The frost beheads it at its play
In accidental power.
The blond assassin passes on,
The sun proceeds unmoved
To measure off another day
For an approving God.





XXVI.

'T WAS later when the summer went
Than when the cricket came,
And yet we knew that gentle clock
Meant nought but going home.

'T was sooner when the cricket went
Than when the winter came,
Yet that pathetic pendulum
Keeps esoteric time.





XXVII.

INDIAN SUMMER.

These are the days when birds come back,
A very few, a bird or two,
To take a backward look.

These are the days when skies put on
The old, old sophistries of June, --
A blue and gold mistake.

Oh, fraud that cannot cheat the bee,
Almost thy plausibility
Induces my belief,

Till ranks of seeds their witness bear,
And softly through the altered air
Hurries a timid leaf!

Oh, sacrament of summer days,
Oh, last communion in the haze,
Permit a child to join,

Thy sacred emblems to partake,
Thy consecrated bread to break,
Taste thine immortal wine!





XXVIII.

AUTUMN.

The morns are meeker than they were,
The nuts are getting brown;
The berry's cheek is plumper,
The rose is out of town.

The maple wears a gayer scarf,
The field a scarlet gown.
Lest I should be old-fashioned,
I'll put a trinket on.





XXIX.

BECLOUDED.

The sky is low, the clouds are mean,
A travelling flake of snow
Across a barn or through a rut
Debates if it will go.

A narrow wind complains all day
How some one treated him;
Nature, like us, is sometimes caught
Without her diadem.





XXX.

THE HEMLOCK.

I think the hemlock likes to stand
Upon a marge of snow;
It suits his own austerity,
And satisfies an awe

That men must slake in wilderness,
Or in the desert cloy, --
An instinct for the hoar, the bald,
Lapland's necessity.

The hemlock's nature thrives on cold;
The gnash of northern winds
Is sweetest nutriment to him,
His best Norwegian wines.

To satin races he is nought;
But children on the Don
Beneath his tabernacles play,
And Dnieper wrestlers run.





XXXI.

There's a certain slant of light,
On winter afternoons,
That oppresses, like the weight
Of cathedral tunes.

Heavenly hurt it gives us;
We can find no scar,
But internal difference
Where the meanings are.

None may teach it anything,
' T is the seal, despair, --
An imperial affliction
Sent us of the air.

When it comes, the landscape listens,
Shadows hold their breath;
When it goes, 't is like the distance
On the look of death.






IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.

I.

One dignity delays for all,
One mitred afternoon.
None can avoid this purple,
None evade this crown.

Coach it insures, and footmen,
Chamber and state and throng;
Bells, also, in the village,
As we ride grand along.

What dignified attendants,
What service when we pause!
How loyally at parting
Their hundred hats they raise!

How pomp surpassing ermine,
When simple you and I
Present our meek escutcheon,
And claim the rank to die!





II.

TOO LATE.

Delayed till she had ceased to know,
Delayed till in its vest of snow
   Her loving bosom lay.
An hour behind the fleeting breath,
Later by just an hour than death, --
   Oh, lagging yesterday!

Could she have guessed that it would be;
Could but a crier of the glee
   Have climbed the distant hill;
Had not the bliss so slow a pace, --
Who knows but this surrendered face
   Were undefeated still?

Oh, if there may departing be
Any forgot by victory
   In her imperial round,
Show them this meek apparelled thing,
That could not stop to be a king,
   Doubtful if it be crowned!





III.

ASTRA CASTRA.

Departed to the judgment,
A mighty afternoon;
Great clouds like ushers leaning,
Creation looking on.

The flesh surrendered, cancelled,
The bodiless begun;
Two worlds, like audiences, disperse
And leave the soul alone.





IV.

Safe in their alabaster chambers,
Untouched by morning and untouched by noon,
Sleep the meek members of the resurrection,
Rafter of satin, and roof of stone.

Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine;
Babbles the bee in a stolid ear;
Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence, --
Ah, what sagacity perished here!

Grand go the years in the crescent above them;
Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,
Diadems drop and Doges surrender,
Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.





V.

On this long storm the rainbow rose,
On this late morn the sun;
The clouds, like listless elephants,
Horizons straggled down.

The birds rose smiling in their nests,
The gales indeed were done;
Alas! how heedless were the eyes
On whom the summer shone!

The quiet nonchalance of death
No daybreak can bestir;
The slow archangel's syllables
Must awaken her.





VI.

FROM THE CHRYSALIS.

My cocoon tightens, colors tease,
I'm feeling for the air;
A dim capacity for wings
Degrades the dress I wear.

A power of butterfly must be
The aptitude to fly,
Meadows of majesty concedes
And easy sweeps of sky.

So I must baffle at the hint
And cipher at the sign,
And make much blunder, if at last
I take the clew divine.





VII.

SETTING SAIL.

Exultation is the going
Of an inland soul to sea, --
Past the houses, past the headlands,
Into deep eternity!

Bred as we, among the mountains,
Can the sailor understand
The divine intoxication
Of the first league out from land?





VIII.

Look back on time with kindly eyes,
He doubtless did his best;
How softly sinks his trembling sun
In human nature's west!





IX.

A train went through a burial gate,
A bird broke forth and sang,
And trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat
Till all the churchyard rang;

And then adjusted his little notes,
And bowed and sang again.
Doubtless, he thought it meet of him
To say good-by to men.





X.

I died for beauty, but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.

He questioned softly why I failed?
"For beauty," I replied.
"And I for truth, -- the two are one;
We brethren are," he said.

And so, as kinsmen met a night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names.





XI.

"TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS."

How many times these low feet staggered,
Only the soldered mouth can tell;
Try! can you stir the awful rivet?
Try! can you lift the hasps of steel?

Stroke the cool forehead, hot so often,
Lift, if you can, the listless hair;
Handle the adamantine fingers
Never a thimble more shall wear.

Buzz the dull flies on the chamber window;
Brave shines the sun through the freckled pane;
Fearless the cobweb swings from the ceiling --
Indolent housewife, in daisies lain!





XII.

REAL.

I like a look of agony,
Because I know it 's true;
Men do not sham convulsion,
Nor simulate a throe.

The eyes glaze once, and that is death.
Impossible to feign
The beads upon the forehead
By homely anguish strung.





XIII.

THE FUNERAL.

That short, potential stir
That each can make but once,
That bustle so illustrious
'T is almost consequence,

Is the eclat of death.
Oh, thou unknown renown
That not a beggar would accept,
Had he the power to spurn!





XIV.

I went to thank her,
But she slept;
Her bed a funnelled stone,
With nosegays at the head and foot,
That travellers had thrown,

Who went to thank her;
But she slept.
'T was short to cross the sea
To look upon her like, alive,
But turning back 't was slow.





XV.

I've seen a dying eye
Run round and round a room
In search of something, as it seemed,
Then cloudier become;
And then, obscure with fog,
And then be soldered down,
Without disclosing what it be,
'T were blessed to have seen.





XVI.

REFUGE.

The clouds their backs together laid,
The north begun to push,
The forests galloped till they fell,
The lightning skipped like mice;
The thunder crumbled like a stuff --
How good to be safe in tombs,
Where nature's temper cannot reach,
Nor vengeance ever comes!





XVII.

I never saw a moor,
I never saw the sea;
Yet know I how the heather looks,
And what a wave must be.

I never spoke with God,
Nor visited in heaven;
Yet certain am I of the spot
As if the chart were given.





XVIII.

PLAYMATES.

God permits industrious angels
Afternoons to play.
I met one, -- forgot my school-mates,
All, for him, straightway.

God calls home the angels promptly
At the setting sun;
I missed mine. How dreary marbles,
After playing Crown!





XIX.

To know just how he suffered would be dear;
To know if any human eyes were near
To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze,
Until it settled firm on Paradise.

To know if he was patient, part content,
Was dying as he thought, or different;
Was it a pleasant day to die,
And did the sunshine face his way?

What was his furthest mind, of home, or God,
Or what the distant say
At news that he ceased human nature
On such a day?

And wishes, had he any?
Just his sigh, accented,
Had been legible to me.
And was he confident until
Ill fluttered out in everlasting well?

And if he spoke, what name was best,
What first,
What one broke off with
At the drowsiest?

Was he afraid, or tranquil?
Might he know
How conscious consciousness could grow,
Till love that was, and love too blest to be,
Meet -- and the junction be Eternity?





XX.

The last night that she lived,
It was a common night,
Except the dying; this to us
Made nature different.

We noticed smallest things, --
Things overlooked before,
By this great light upon our minds
Italicized, as 't were.

That others could exist
While she must finish quite,
A jealousy for her arose
So nearly infinite.

We waited while she passed;
It was a narrow time,
Too jostled were our souls to speak,
At length the notice came.

She mentioned, and forgot;
Then lightly as a reed
Bent to the water, shivered scarce,
Consented, and was dead.

And we, we placed the hair,
And drew the head erect;
And then an awful leisure was,
Our faith to regulate.





XXI.

THE FIRST LESSON.

Not in this world to see his face
Sounds long, until I read the place
Where this is said to be
But just the primer to a life
Unopened, rare, upon the shelf,
Clasped yet to him and me.

And yet, my primer suits me so
I would not choose a book to know
Than that, be sweeter wise;
Might some one else so learned be,
And leave me just my A B C,
Himself could have the skies.





XXII.

The bustle in a house
The morning after death
Is solemnest of industries
Enacted upon earth, --

The sweeping up the heart,
And putting love away
We shall not want to use again
Until eternity.





XXIII.

I reason, earth is short,
And anguish absolute,
And many hurt;
But what of that?

I reason, we could die:
The best vitality
Cannot excel decay;
But what of that?

I reason that in heaven
Somehow, it will be even,
Some new equation given;
But what of that?





XXIV.

Afraid? Of whom am I afraid?
Not death; for who is he?
The porter of my father's lodge
As much abasheth me.

Of life? 'T were odd I fear a thing
That comprehendeth me
In one or more existences
At Deity's decree.

Of resurrection? Is the east
Afraid to trust the morn
With her fastidious forehead?
As soon impeach my crown!





XXV.

DYING.

The sun kept setting, setting still;
No hue of afternoon
Upon the village I perceived, --
From house to house 't was noon.

The dusk kept dropping, dropping still;
No dew upon the grass,
But only on my forehead stopped,
And wandered in my face.

My feet kept drowsing, drowsing still,
My fingers were awake;
Yet why so little sound myself
Unto my seeming make?

How well I knew the light before!
I could not see it now.
'T is dying, I am doing; but
I'm not afraid to know.





XXVI.

Two swimmers wrestled on the spar
Until the morning sun,
When one turned smiling to the land.
O God, the other one!

The stray ships passing spied a face
Upon the waters borne,
With eyes in death still begging raised,
And hands beseeching thrown.





XXVII.

THE CHARIOT.

Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me;
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality.

We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away
My labor, and my leisure too,
For his civility.

We passed the school where children played,
Their lessons scarcely done;
We passed the fields of gazing grain,
We passed the setting sun.

We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground;
The roof was scarcely visible,
The cornice but a mound.

Since then 't is centuries; but each
Feels shorter than the day
I first surmised the horses' heads
Were toward eternity.





XXVIII.

She went as quiet as the dew
From a familiar flower.
Not like the dew did she return
At the accustomed hour!

She dropt as softly as a star
From out my summer's eve;
Less skilful than Leverrier
It's sorer to believe!





XXIX.

RESURGAM.

At last to be identified!
At last, the lamps upon thy side,
The rest of life to see!
Past midnight, past the morning star!
Past sunrise! Ah! what leagues there are
Between our feet and day!





XXX.

Except to heaven, she is nought;
Except for angels, lone;
Except to some wide-wandering bee,
A flower superfluous blown;

Except for winds, provincial;
Except by butterflies,
Unnoticed as a single dew
That on the acre lies.

The smallest housewife in the grass,
Yet take her from the lawn,
And somebody has lost the face
That made existence home!





XXXI.

Death is a dialogue between
The spirit and the dust.
"Dissolve," says Death. The Spirit, "Sir,
I have another trust."

Death doubts it, argues from the ground.
The Spirit turns away,
Just laying off, for evidence,
An overcoat of clay.





XXXII.

It was too late for man,
But early yet for God;
Creation impotent to help,
But prayer remained our side.

How excellent the heaven,
When earth cannot be had;
How hospitable, then, the face
Of our old neighbor, God!





XXXIII.

ALONG THE POTOMAC.

When I was small, a woman died.
To-day her only boy
Went up from the Potomac,
His face all victory,

To look at her; how slowly
The seasons must have turned
Till bullets clipt an angle,
And he passed quickly round!

If pride shall be in Paradise
I never can decide;
Of their imperial conduct,
No person testified.

But proud in apparition,
That woman and her boy
Pass back and forth before my brain,
As ever in the sky.





XXXIV.

The daisy follows soft the sun,
And when his golden walk is done,
   Sits shyly at his feet.
He, waking, finds the flower near.
"Wherefore, marauder, art thou here?"
   "Because, sir, love is sweet!"

We are the flower, Thou the sun!
Forgive us, if as days decline,
   We nearer steal to Thee, --
Enamoured of the parting west,
The peace, the flight, the amethyst,
   Night's possibility!





XXXV.

EMANCIPATION.

No rack can torture me,
My soul's at liberty
Behind this mortal bone
There knits a bolder one

You cannot prick with saw,
Nor rend with scymitar.
Two bodies therefore be;
Bind one, and one will flee.

The eagle of his nest
No easier divest
And gain the sky,
Than mayest thou,

Except thyself may be
Thine enemy;
Captivity is consciousness,
So's liberty.





XXXVI.

LOST.

I lost a world the other day.
Has anybody found?
You'll know it by the row of stars
Around its forehead bound.

A rich man might not notice it;
Yet to my frugal eye
Of more esteem than ducats.
Oh, find it, sir, for me!





XXXVII.

If I shouldn't be alive
When the robins come,
Give the one in red cravat
A memorial crumb.

If I couldn't thank you,
Being just asleep,
You will know I'm trying
With my granite lip!





XXXVIII.

Sleep is supposed to be,
By souls of sanity,
The shutting of the eye.

Sleep is the station grand
Down which on either hand
The hosts of witness stand!

Morn is supposed to be,
By people of degree,
The breaking of the day.

Morning has not occurred!
That shall aurora be
East of eternity;

One with the banner gay,
One in the red array, --
That is the break of day.





XXXIX.

I shall know why, when time is over,
And I have ceased to wonder why;
Christ will explain each separate anguish
In the fair schoolroom of the sky.

He will tell me what Peter promised,
And I, for wonder at his woe,
I shall forget the drop of anguish
That scalds me now, that scalds me now.





XL.

I never lost as much but twice,
And that was in the sod;
Twice have I stood a beggar
Before the door of God!

Angels, twice descending,
Reimbursed my store.
Burglar, banker, father,
I am poor once more!






POEMS

by EMILY DICKINSON

Second Series




Edited by two of her friends

MABEL LOOMIS TODD and T.W. HIGGINSON




PREFACE

The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's
poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern
artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the
qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest
themes,--life and love and death. That "irresistible needle-touch,"
as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very
core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as
it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling
power.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to
form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties.

Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending
occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of
her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend "H.H."
must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th
September, 1884, she wrote:--


MY DEAR FRIEND,-- What portfolios full of verses
you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your "day and
generation" that you will not give them light.

If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive
you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee
and executor. Surely after you are what is called
"dead" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you
have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your
verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think
we have a right to withhold from the world a word or
a thought any more than a deed which might help a
single soul. . . .

                Truly yours,

                        HELEN JACKSON.


The "portfolios" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death,
by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had
been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little
fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear
evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had
received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of
rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and
phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one
form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without
important exception, her friends have generously placed at the
disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and
these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several
renderings of the same verse.

To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been
subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They
should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and
suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some
time in the finished picture.

Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the
winter of 1862. In a letter to oone of the present Editors the
April following, she says, "I made no verse, but one or two, until
this winter."

The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running
Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in
breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her
latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its
fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,
everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous
dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of
a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and
strong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of
the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,
the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general
chronologic accuracy.

As a rule, the verses were without titles; but "A Country Burial,"
"A Thunder-Storm," "The Humming-Bird," and a few others were named
by their author, frequently at the end,--sometimes only in the
accompanying note, if sent to a friend.

The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in
pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of
responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not
absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her
rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it
seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and
more usual rhymes.

Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very
absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily
Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a
particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything
virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of
inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and
the "thought-rhyme" appears frequently,--appealing, indeed, to an
unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.

Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness.
Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the
sombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She
touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost
humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is
never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic
has said, she may exhibit toward God "an Emersonian self-possession,"
it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced
as it is rare.

She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking.  She
was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no
love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature
introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist
in pretence.

Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and
bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted
human friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the
first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of
pope; the first red leaf hurrying through "the altered air," an
epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or
melancholy, she lived in its presence.

                                MABEL LOOMIS TODD.

        AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS,
            August, I891.











    My nosegays are for captives;
       Dim, long-expectant eyes,
    Fingers denied the plucking,
       Patient till paradise,

    To such, if they should whisper
       Of morning and the moor,
    They bear no other errand,
       And I, no other prayer.




I. LIFE.


I.

I'm nobody!  Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there 's a pair of us -- don't tell!
They 'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!





II.

I bring an unaccustomed wine
To lips long parching, next to mine,
And summon them to drink.

Crackling with fever, they essay;
I turn my brimming eyes away,
And come next hour to look.

The hands still hug the tardy glass;
The lips I would have cooled, alas!
Are so superfluous cold,

I would as soon attempt to warm
The bosoms where the frost has lain
Ages beneath the mould.

Some other thirsty there may be
To whom this would have pointed me
Had it remained to speak.

And so I always bear the cup
If, haply, mine may be the drop
Some pilgrim thirst to slake, --

If, haply, any say to me,
"Unto the little, unto me,"
When I at last awake.





III.

The nearest dream recedes, unrealized.
      The heaven we chase
      Like the June bee
      Before the school-boy
      Invites the race;
      Stoops to an easy clover --
Dips -- evades -- teases -- deploys;
      Then to the royal clouds
      Lifts his light pinnace
      Heedless of the boy
Staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.

      Homesick for steadfast honey,
      Ah! the bee flies not
That brews that rare variety.





IV.

We play at paste,
Till qualified for pearl,
Then drop the paste,
And deem ourself a fool.
The shapes, though, were similar,
And our new hands
Learned gem-tactics
Practising sands.





V.

I found the phrase to every thought
I ever had, but one;
And that defies me, -- as a hand
Did try to chalk the sun

To races nurtured in the dark; --
How would your own begin?
Can blaze be done in cochineal,
Or noon in mazarin?





VI.

HOPE.

Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all,

And sweetest in the gale is heard;
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little bird
That kept so many warm.

I 've heard it in the chillest land,
And on the strangest sea;
Yet, never, in extremity,
It asked a crumb of me.





VII.

THE WHITE HEAT.

Dare you see a soul at the white heat?
   Then crouch within the door.
Red is the fire's common tint;
   But when the vivid ore

Has sated flame's conditions,
   Its quivering substance plays
Without a color but the light
   Of unanointed blaze.

Least village boasts its blacksmith,
   Whose anvil's even din
Stands symbol for the finer forge
   That soundless tugs within,

Refining these impatient ores
   With hammer and with blaze,
Until the designated light
   Repudiate the forge.





VIII.

TRIUMPHANT.

Who never lost, are unprepared
A coronet to find;
Who never thirsted, flagons
And cooling tamarind.

Who never climbed the weary league --
Can such a foot explore
The purple territories
On Pizarro's shore?

How many legions overcome?
The emperor will say.
How many colors taken
On Revolution Day?

How many bullets bearest?
The royal scar hast thou?
Angels, write "Promoted"
On this soldier's brow!





IX.

THE TEST.

I can wade grief,
Whole pools of it, --
I 'm used to that.
But the least push of joy
Breaks up my feet,
And I tip -- drunken.
Let no pebble smile,
'T was the new liquor, --
That was all!

Power is only pain,
Stranded, through discipline,
Till weights will hang.
Give balm to giants,
And they 'll wilt, like men.
Give Himmaleh, --
They 'll carry him!





X.

ESCAPE.

I never hear the word "escape"
Without a quicker blood,
A sudden expectation,
A flying attitude.

I never hear of prisons broad
By soldiers battered down,
But I tug childish at my bars, --
Only to fail again!






XI.

COMPENSATION.

For each ecstatic instant
We must an anguish pay
In keen and quivering ratio
To the ecstasy.

For each beloved hour
Sharp pittances of years,
Bitter contested farthings
And coffers heaped with tears.





XII.

THE MARTYRS.

Through the straight pass of suffering
The martyrs even trod,
Their feet upon temptation,
Their faces upon God.

A stately, shriven company;
Convulsion playing round,
Harmless as streaks of meteor
Upon a planet's bound.

Their faith the everlasting troth;
Their expectation fair;
The needle to the north degree
Wades so, through polar air.





XIII.

A PRAYER.

I meant to have but modest needs,
Such as content, and heaven;
Within my income these could lie,
And life and I keep even.

But since the last included both,
It would suffice my prayer
But just for one to stipulate,
And grace would grant the pair.

And so, upon this wise I prayed, --
Great Spirit, give to me
A heaven not so large as yours,
But large enough for me.

A smile suffused Jehovah's face;
The cherubim withdrew;
Grave saints stole out to look at me,
And showed their dimples, too.

I left the place with all my might, --
My prayer away I threw;
The quiet ages picked it up,
And Judgment twinkled, too,

That one so honest be extant
As take the tale for true
That "Whatsoever you shall ask,
Itself be given you."

But I, grown shrewder, scan the skies
With a suspicious air, --
As children, swindled for the first,
All swindlers be, infer.





XIV.

The thought beneath so slight a film
Is more distinctly seen, --
As laces just reveal the surge,
Or mists the Apennine.





XV.

The soul unto itself
Is an imperial friend, --
Or the most agonizing spy
An enemy could send.

Secure against its own,
No treason it can fear;
Itself its sovereign, of itself
The soul should stand in awe.





XVI.

Surgeons must be very careful
When they take the knife!
Underneath their fine incisions
Stirs the culprit, -- Life!





XVII.

THE RAILWAY TRAIN.

I like to see it lap the miles,
And lick the valleys up,
And stop to feed itself at tanks;
And then, prodigious, step

Around a pile of mountains,
And, supercilious, peer
In shanties by the sides of roads;
And then a quarry pare

To fit its sides, and crawl between,
Complaining all the while
In horrid, hooting stanza;
Then chase itself down hill

And neigh like Boanerges;
Then, punctual as a star,
Stop -- docile and omnipotent --
At its own stable door.





XVIII.

THE SHOW.

The show is not the show,
But they that go.
Menagerie to me
My neighbor be.
Fair play --
Both went to see.





XIX.

Delight becomes pictorial
When viewed through pain, --
More fair, because impossible
That any gain.

The mountain at a given distance
In amber lies;
Approached, the amber flits a little, --
And that 's the skies!





XX.

A thought went up my mind to-day
That I have had before,
But did not finish, -- some way back,
I could not fix the year,

Nor where it went, nor why it came
The second time to me,
Nor definitely what it was,
Have I the art to say.

But somewhere in my soul, I know
I 've met the thing before;
It just reminded me -- 't was all --
And came my way no more.





XXI.

Is Heaven a physician?
They say that He can heal;
But medicine posthumous
   Is unavailable.

Is Heaven an exchequer?
   They speak of what we owe;
But that negotiation
   I 'm not a party to.





XXII.

THE RETURN.

Though I get home how late, how late!
So I get home, 't will compensate.
Better will be the ecstasy
That they have done expecting me,
When, night descending, dumb and dark,
They hear my unexpected knock.
Transporting must the moment be,
Brewed from decades of agony!

To think just how the fire will burn,
Just how long-cheated eyes will turn
To wonder what myself will say,
And what itself will say to me,
Beguiles the centuries of way!





XXIII.

A poor torn heart, a tattered heart,
That sat it down to rest,
Nor noticed that the ebbing day
Flowed silver to the west,
Nor noticed night did soft descend
Nor constellation burn,
Intent upon the vision
Of latitudes unknown.

The angels, happening that way,
This dusty heart espied;
Tenderly took it up from toil
And carried it to God.
There, -- sandals for the barefoot;
There, -- gathered from the gales,
Do the blue havens by the hand
Lead the wandering sails.





XXIV.

TOO MUCH.

I should have been too glad, I see,
Too lifted for the scant degree
   Of life's penurious round;
My little circuit would have shamed
This new circumference, have blamed
   The homelier time behind.

I should have been too saved, I see,
Too rescued; fear too dim to me
   That I could spell the prayer
I knew so perfect yesterday, --
That scalding one, "Sabachthani,"
   Recited fluent here.

Earth would have been too much, I see,
And heaven not enough for me;
   I should have had the joy
Without the fear to justify, --
The palm without the Calvary;
   So, Saviour, crucify.

Defeat whets victory, they say;
The reefs in old Gethsemane
   Endear the shore beyond.
'T is beggars banquets best define;
'T is thirsting vitalizes wine, --
   Faith faints to understand.





XXV.

SHIPWRECK.

It tossed and tossed, --
A little brig I knew, --
O'ertook by blast,
It spun and spun,
And groped delirious, for morn.

It slipped and slipped,
As one that drunken stepped;
Its white foot tripped,
Then dropped from sight.

Ah, brig, good-night
To crew and you;
The ocean's heart too smooth, too blue,
To break for you.





XXVI.

Victory comes late,
And is held low to freezing lips
Too rapt with frost
To take it.
How sweet it would have tasted,
Just a drop!
Was God so economical?
His table 's spread too high for us
Unless we dine on tip-toe.
Crumbs fit such little mouths,
Cherries suit robins;
The eagle's golden breakfast
Strangles them.
God keeps his oath to sparrows,
Who of little love
Know how to starve!





XXVII.

ENOUGH.

God gave a loaf to every bird,
But just a crumb to me;
I dare not eat it, though I starve, --
My poignant luxury
To own it, touch it, prove the feat
That made the pellet mine, --
Too happy in my sparrow chance
For ampler coveting.

It might be famine all around,
I could not miss an ear,
Such plenty smiles upon my board,
My garner shows so fair.
I wonder how the rich may feel, --
An Indiaman -- an Earl?
I deem that I with but a crumb
Am sovereign of them all.





XXVIII.

Experiment to me
Is every one I meet.
If it contain a kernel?
The figure of a nut

Presents upon a tree,
Equally plausibly;
But meat within is requisite,
To squirrels and to me.





XXIX.

MY COUNTRY'S WARDROBE.

My country need not change her gown,
Her triple suit as sweet
As when 't was cut at Lexington,
And first pronounced "a fit."

Great Britain disapproves "the stars;"
Disparagement discreet, --
There 's something in their attitude
That taunts her bayonet.





XXX.

Faith is a fine invention
For gentlemen who see;
But microscopes are prudent
In an emergency!





XXXI.

Except the heaven had come so near,
So seemed to choose my door,
The distance would not haunt me so;
I had not hoped before.

But just to hear the grace depart
I never thought to see,
Afflicts me with a double loss;
'T is lost, and lost to me.





XXXII.

Portraits are to daily faces
As an evening west
To a fine, pedantic sunshine
In a satin vest.





XXXIII.

THE DUEL.

I took my power in my hand.
And went against the world;
'T was not so much as David had,
But I was twice as bold.

I aimed my pebble, but myself
Was all the one that fell.
Was it Goliath was too large,
Or only I too small?





XXXIV.

A shady friend for torrid days
Is easier to find
Than one of higher temperature
For frigid hour of mind.

The vane a little to the east
Scares muslin souls away;
If broadcloth breasts are firmer
Than those of organdy,

Who is to blame? The weaver?
Ah! the bewildering thread!
The tapestries of paradise
So notelessly are made!





XXXV.

THE GOAL.

Each life converges to some centre
Expressed or still;
Exists in every human nature
A goal,

Admitted scarcely to itself, it may be,
Too fair
For credibility's temerity
To dare.

Adored with caution, as a brittle heaven,
To reach
Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment
To touch,

Yet persevered toward, surer for the distance;
How high
Unto the saints' slow diligence
The sky!

Ungained, it may be, by a life's low venture,
But then,
Eternity enables the endeavoring
Again.





XXXVI.

SIGHT.

Before I got my eye put out,
I liked as well to see
As other creatures that have eyes,
And know no other way.

But were it told to me, to-day,
That I might have the sky
For mine, I tell you that my heart
Would split, for size of me.

The meadows mine, the mountains mine, --
All forests, stintless stars,
As much of noon as I could take
Between my finite eyes.

The motions of the dipping birds,
The lightning's jointed road,
For mine to look at when I liked, --
The news would strike me dead!

So safer, guess, with just my soul
Upon the window-pane
Where other creatures put their eyes,
Incautious of the sun.





XXXVII.

Talk with prudence to a beggar
Of 'Potosi' and the mines!
Reverently to the hungry
Of your viands and your wines!

Cautious, hint to any captive
You have passed enfranchised feet!
Anecdotes of air in dungeons
Have sometimes proved deadly sweet!





XXXVIII.

THE PREACHER.

He preached upon "breadth" till it argued him narrow, --
The broad are too broad to define;
And of "truth" until it proclaimed him a liar, --
The truth never flaunted a sign.

Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
As gold the pyrites would shun.
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus
To meet so enabled a man!





XXXIX.

Good night! which put the candle out?
A jealous zephyr, not a doubt.
   Ah! friend, you little knew
How long at that celestial wick
The angels labored diligent;
   Extinguished, now, for you!

It might have been the lighthouse spark
Some sailor, rowing in the dark,
   Had importuned to see!
It might have been the waning lamp
That lit the drummer from the camp
   To purer reveille!





XL.

When I hoped I feared,
Since I hoped I dared;
Everywhere alone
As a church remain;
Spectre cannot harm,
Serpent cannot charm;
He deposes doom,
Who hath suffered him.





XLI.

DEED.

A deed knocks first at thought,
And then it knocks at will.
That is the manufacturing spot,
And will at home and well.

It then goes out an act,
Or is entombed so still
That only to the ear of God
Its doom is audible.





XLII.

TIME'S LESSON.

Mine enemy is growing old, --
I have at last revenge.
The palate of the hate departs;
If any would avenge, --

Let him be quick, the viand flits,
It is a faded meat.
Anger as soon as fed is dead;
'T is starving makes it fat.





XLIII.

REMORSE.

Remorse is memory awake,
Her companies astir, --
A presence of departed acts
At window and at door.

It's past set down before the soul,
And lighted with a match,
Perusal to facilitate
Of its condensed despatch.

Remorse is cureless, -- the disease
Not even God can heal;
For 't is his institution, --
The complement of hell.





XLIV.

THE SHELTER.

The body grows outside, --
The more convenient way, --
That if the spirit like to hide,
Its temple stands alway

Ajar, secure, inviting;
It never did betray
The soul that asked its shelter
In timid honesty.





XLV.

Undue significance a starving man attaches
To food
Far off; he sighs, and therefore hopeless,
And therefore good.

Partaken, it relieves indeed, but proves us
That spices fly
In the receipt. It was the distance
Was savory.





XLVI.

Heart not so heavy as mine,
Wending late home,
As it passed my window
Whistled itself a tune, --

A careless snatch, a ballad,
A ditty of the street;
Yet to my irritated ear
An anodyne so sweet,

It was as if a bobolink,
Sauntering this way,
Carolled and mused and carolled,
Then bubbled slow away.

It was as if a chirping brook
Upon a toilsome way
Set bleeding feet to minuets
Without the knowing why.

To-morrow, night will come again,
Weary, perhaps, and sore.
Ah, bugle, by my window,
I pray you stroll once more!





XLVII.

I many times thought peace had come,
When peace was far away;
As wrecked men deem they sight the land
At centre of the sea,

And struggle slacker, but to prove,
As hopelessly as I,
How many the fictitious shores
Before the harbor lie.





XLVIII.

Unto my books so good to turn
Far ends of tired days;
It half endears the abstinence,
And pain is missed in praise.

As flavors cheer retarded guests
With banquetings to be,
So spices stimulate the time
Till my small library.

It may be wilderness without,
Far feet of failing men,
But holiday excludes the night,
And it is bells within.

I thank these kinsmen of the shelf;
Their countenances bland
Enamour in prospective,
And satisfy, obtained.





XLIX.

This merit hath the worst, --
It cannot be again.
When Fate hath taunted last
And thrown her furthest stone,

The maimed may pause and breathe,
And glance securely round.
The deer invites no longer
Than it eludes the hound.





L.

HUNGER.

I had been hungry all the years;
My noon had come, to dine;
I, trembling, drew the table near,
And touched the curious wine.

'T was this on tables I had seen,
When turning, hungry, lone,
I looked in windows, for the wealth
I could not hope to own.

I did not know the ample bread,
'T was so unlike the crumb
The birds and I had often shared
In Nature's dining-room.

The plenty hurt me, 't was so new, --
Myself felt ill and odd,
As berry of a mountain bush
Transplanted to the road.

Nor was I hungry; so I found
That hunger was a way
Of persons outside windows,
The entering takes away.





LI.

I gained it so,
      By climbing slow,
By catching at the twigs that grow
Between the bliss and me.
      It hung so high,
      As well the sky
      Attempt by strategy.


I said I gained it, --
      This was all.
Look, how I clutch it,
      Lest it fall,
And I a pauper go;
Unfitted by an instant's grace
For the contented beggar's face
I wore an hour ago.





LII.

To learn the transport by the pain,
As blind men learn the sun;
To die of thirst, suspecting
That brooks in meadows run;

To stay the homesick, homesick feet
Upon a foreign shore
Haunted by native lands, the while,
And blue, beloved air --

This is the sovereign anguish,
This, the signal woe!
These are the patient laureates
Whose voices, trained below,

Ascend in ceaseless carol,
Inaudible, indeed,
To us, the duller scholars
Of the mysterious bard!





LIII.

RETURNING.

I years had been from home,
And now, before the door,
I dared not open, lest a face
I never saw before

Stare vacant into mine
And ask my business there.
My business, -- just a life I left,
Was such still dwelling there?

I fumbled at my nerve,
I scanned the windows near;
The silence like an ocean rolled,
And broke against my ear.

I laughed a wooden laugh
That I could fear a door,
Who danger and the dead had faced,
But never quaked before.

I fitted to the latch
My hand, with trembling care,
Lest back the awful door should spring,
And leave me standing there.

I moved my fingers off
As cautiously as glass,
And held my ears, and like a thief
Fled gasping from the house.





LIV.

PRAYER.

Prayer is the little implement
Through which men reach
Where presence is denied them.
They fling their speech

By means of it in God's ear;
If then He hear,
This sums the apparatus
Comprised in prayer.





LV.

I know that he exists
Somewhere, in silence.
He has hid his rare life
From our gross eyes.

'T is an instant's play,
'T is a fond ambush,
Just to make bliss
Earn her own surprise!

But should the play
Prove piercing earnest,
Should the glee glaze
In death's stiff stare,

Would not the fun
Look too expensive?
Would not the jest
Have crawled too far?





LVI.

MELODIES UNHEARD.

Musicians wrestle everywhere:
All day, among the crowded air,
  I hear the silver strife;
And -- waking long before the dawn --
Such transport breaks upon the town
  I think it that "new life!"

It is not bird, it has no nest;
Nor band, in brass and scarlet dressed,
  Nor tambourine, nor man;
It is not hymn from pulpit read, --
The morning stars the treble led
  On time's first afternoon!

Some say it is the spheres at play!
Some say that bright majority
  Of vanished dames and men!
Some think it service in the place
Where we, with late, celestial face,
  Please God, shall ascertain!





LVII.

CALLED BACK.

Just lost when I was saved!
Just felt the world go by!
Just girt me for the onset with eternity,
When breath blew back,
And on the other side
I heard recede the disappointed tide!

Therefore, as one returned, I feel,
Odd secrets of the line to tell!
Some sailor, skirting foreign shores,
Some pale reporter from the awful doors
Before the seal!

Next time, to stay!
Next time, the things to see
By ear unheard,
Unscrutinized by eye.

Next time, to tarry,
While the ages steal, --
Slow tramp the centuries,
And the cycles wheel.






II. LOVE.


I.

CHOICE.

Of all the souls that stand create
I have elected one.
When sense from spirit files away,
And subterfuge is done;

When that which is and that which was
Apart, intrinsic, stand,
And this brief tragedy of flesh
Is shifted like a sand;

When figures show their royal front
And mists are carved away, --
Behold the atom I preferred
To all the lists of clay!





II.

I have no life but this,
To lead it here;
Nor any death, but lest
Dispelled from there;

Nor tie to earths to come,
Nor action new,
Except through this extent,
The realm of you.





III.

Your riches taught me poverty.
Myself a millionnaire
In little wealths, -- as girls could boast, --
Till broad as Buenos Ayre,

You drifted your dominions
A different Peru;
And I esteemed all poverty,
For life's estate with you.

Of mines I little know, myself,
But just the names of gems, --
The colors of the commonest;
And scarce of diadems

So much that, did I meet the queen,
Her glory I should know:
But this must be a different wealth,
To miss it beggars so.

I 'm sure 't is India all day
To those who look on you
Without a stint, without a blame, --
Might I but be the Jew!

I 'm sure it is Golconda,
Beyond my power to deem, --
To have a smile for mine each day,
How better than a gem!

At least, it solaces to know
That there exists a gold,
Although I prove it just in time
Its distance to behold!

It 's far, far treasure to surmise,
And estimate the pearl
That slipped my simple fingers through
While just a girl at school!





IV.

THE CONTRACT.

I gave myself to him,
And took himself for pay.
The solemn contract of a life
Was ratified this way.

The wealth might disappoint,
Myself a poorer prove
Than this great purchaser suspect,
The daily own of Love

Depreciate the vision;
But, till the merchant buy,
Still fable, in the isles of spice,
The subtle cargoes lie.

At least, 't is mutual risk, --
Some found it mutual gain;
Sweet debt of Life, -- each night to owe,
Insolvent, every noon.





V.

THE LETTER.

"GOING to him! Happy letter! Tell him --
Tell him the page I didn't write;
Tell him I only said the syntax,
And left the verb and the pronoun out.
Tell him just how the fingers hurried,
Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow;
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages,
So you could see what moved them so.

"Tell him it wasn't a practised writer,
You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;
You could hear the bodice tug, behind you,
As if it held but the might of a child;
You almost pitied it, you, it worked so.
Tell him -- No, you may quibble there,
For it would split his heart to know it,
And then you and I were silenter.

"Tell him night finished before we finished,
And the old clock kept neighing 'day!'
And you got sleepy and begged to be ended --
What could it hinder so, to say?
Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious,
But if he ask where you are hid
Until to-morrow, -- happy letter!
Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!"





VI.

The way I read a letter 's this:
'T is first I lock the door,
And push it with my fingers next,
For transport it be sure.

And then I go the furthest off
To counteract a knock;
Then draw my little letter forth
And softly pick its lock.

Then, glancing narrow at the wall,
And narrow at the floor,
For firm conviction of a mouse
Not exorcised before,

Peruse how infinite I am
To -- no one that you know!
And sigh for lack of heaven, -- but not
The heaven the creeds bestow.





VII.

Wild nights! Wild nights!
Were I with thee,
Wild nights should be
Our luxury!

Futile the winds
To a heart in port, --
Done with the compass,
Done with the chart.

Rowing in Eden!
Ah! the sea!
Might I but moor
To-night in thee!





VIII.

AT HOME.

The night was wide, and furnished scant
With but a single star,
That often as a cloud it met
Blew out itself for fear.

The wind pursued the little bush,
And drove away the leaves
November left; then clambered up
And fretted in the eaves.

No squirrel went abroad;
A dog's belated feet
Like intermittent plush were heard
Adown the empty street.

To feel if blinds be fast,
And closer to the fire
Her little rocking-chair to draw,
And shiver for the poor,

The housewife's gentle task.
"How pleasanter," said she
Unto the sofa opposite,
"The sleet than May -- no thee!"





IX.

POSSESSION.

Did the harebell loose her girdle
To the lover bee,
Would the bee the harebell hallow
Much as formerly?

Did the paradise, persuaded,
Yield her moat of pearl,
Would the Eden be an Eden,
Or the earl an earl?





X.

A charm invests a face
Imperfectly beheld, --
The lady dare not lift her veil
For fear it be dispelled.

But peers beyond her mesh,
And wishes, and denies, --
Lest interview annul a want
That image satisfies.





XI.

THE LOVERS.

The rose did caper on her cheek,
Her bodice rose and fell,
Her pretty speech, like drunken men,
Did stagger pitiful.

Her fingers fumbled at her work, --
Her needle would not go;
What ailed so smart a little maid
It puzzled me to know,

Till opposite I spied a cheek
That bore another rose;
Just opposite, another speech
That like the drunkard goes;

A vest that, like the bodice, danced
To the immortal tune, --
Till those two troubled little clocks
Ticked softly into one.





XII.

In lands I never saw, they say,
Immortal Alps look down,
Whose bonnets touch the firmament,
Whose sandals touch the town, --

Meek at whose everlasting feet
A myriad daisies play.
Which, sir, are you, and which am I,
Upon an August day?





XIII.

The moon is distant from the sea,
And yet with amber hands
She leads him, docile as a boy,
Along appointed sands.

He never misses a degree;
Obedient to her eye,
He comes just so far toward the town,
Just so far goes away.

Oh, Signor, thine the amber hand,
And mine the distant sea, --
Obedient to the least command
Thine eyes impose on me.





XIV.

He put the belt around my life, --
I heard the buckle snap,
And turned away, imperial,
My lifetime folding up
Deliberate, as a duke would do
A kingdom's title-deed, --
Henceforth a dedicated sort,
A member of the cloud.

Yet not too far to come at call,
And do the little toils
That make the circuit of the rest,
And deal occasional smiles
To lives that stoop to notice mine
And kindly ask it in, --
Whose invitation, knew you not
For whom I must decline?





XV.

THE LOST JEWEL.

I held a jewel in my fingers
And went to sleep.
The day was warm, and winds were prosy;
I said: "'T will keep."

I woke and chid my honest fingers, --
The gem was gone;
And now an amethyst remembrance
Is all I own.





XVI.

What if I say I shall not wait?
What if I burst the fleshly gate
And pass, escaped, to thee?
What if I file this mortal off,
See where it hurt me, -- that 's enough, --
And wade in liberty?

They cannot take us any more, --
Dungeons may call, and guns implore;
Unmeaning now, to me,
As laughter was an hour ago,
Or laces, or a travelling show,
Or who died yesterday!









III. NATURE.


I.

MOTHER NATURE.

Nature, the gentlest mother,
Impatient of no child,
The feeblest or the waywardest, --
Her admonition mild

In forest and the hill
By traveller is heard,
Restraining rampant squirrel
Or too impetuous bird.

How fair her conversation,
A summer afternoon, --
Her household, her assembly;
And when the sun goes down

Her voice among the aisles
Incites the timid prayer
Of the minutest cricket,
The most unworthy flower.

When all the children sleep
She turns as long away
As will suffice to light her lamps;
Then, bending from the sky

With infinite affection
And infiniter care,
Her golden finger on her lip,
Wills silence everywhere.





II.

OUT OF THE MORNING.

Will there really be a morning?
Is there such a thing as day?
Could I see it from the mountains
If I were as tall as they?

Has it feet like water-lilies?
Has it feathers like a bird?
Is it brought from famous countries
Of which I have never heard?

Oh, some scholar! Oh, some sailor!
Oh, some wise man from the skies!
Please to tell a little pilgrim
Where the place called morning lies!





III.

At half-past three a single bird
Unto a silent sky
Propounded but a single term
Of cautious melody.

At half-past four, experiment
Had subjugated test,
And lo! her silver principle
Supplanted all the rest.

At half-past seven, element
Nor implement was seen,
And place was where the presence was,
Circumference between.





IV.

DAY'S PARLOR.

The day came slow, till five o'clock,
Then sprang before the hills
Like hindered rubies, or the light
A sudden musket spills.

The purple could not keep the east,
The sunrise shook from fold,
Like breadths of topaz, packed a night,
The lady just unrolled.

The happy winds their timbrels took;
The birds, in docile rows,
Arranged themselves around their prince
(The wind is prince of those).

The orchard sparkled like a Jew, --
How mighty 't was, to stay
A guest in this stupendous place,
The parlor of the day!





V.

THE SUN'S WOOING.

The sun just touched the morning;
The morning, happy thing,
Supposed that he had come to dwell,
And life would be all spring.

She felt herself supremer, --
A raised, ethereal thing;
Henceforth for her what holiday!
Meanwhile, her wheeling king

Trailed slow along the orchards
His haughty, spangled hems,
Leaving a new necessity, --
The want of diadems!

The morning fluttered, staggered,
Felt feebly for her crown, --
Her unanointed forehead
Henceforth her only one.






VI.

THE ROBIN.

The robin is the one
That interrupts the morn
With hurried, few, express reports
When March is scarcely on.

The robin is the one
That overflows the noon
With her cherubic quantity,
An April but begun.

The robin is the one
That speechless from her nest
Submits that home and certainty
And sanctity are best.





VII.

THE BUTTERFLY'S DAY.

From cocoon forth a butterfly
As lady from her door
Emerged -- a summer afternoon --
Repairing everywhere,

Without design, that I could trace,
Except to stray abroad
On miscellaneous enterprise
The clovers understood.

Her pretty parasol was seen
Contracting in a field
Where men made hay, then struggling hard
With an opposing cloud,

Where parties, phantom as herself,
To Nowhere seemed to go
In purposeless circumference,
As 't were a tropic show.

And notwithstanding bee that worked,
And flower that zealous blew,
This audience of idleness
Disdained them, from the sky,

Till sundown crept, a steady tide,
And men that made the hay,
And afternoon, and butterfly,
Extinguished in its sea.





VIII.

THE BLUEBIRD.

Before you thought of spring,
Except as a surmise,
You see, God bless his suddenness,
A fellow in the skies
Of independent hues,
A little weather-worn,
Inspiriting habiliments
Of indigo and brown.

With specimens of song,
As if for you to choose,
Discretion in the interval,
With gay delays he goes
To some superior tree
Without a single leaf,
And shouts for joy to nobody
But his seraphic self!





IX.

APRIL.

An altered look about the hills;
A Tyrian light the village fills;
A wider sunrise in the dawn;
A deeper twilight on the lawn;
A print of a vermilion foot;
A purple finger on the slope;
A flippant fly upon the pane;
A spider at his trade again;
An added strut in chanticleer;
A flower expected everywhere;
An axe shrill singing in the woods;
Fern-odors on untravelled roads, --
All this, and more I cannot tell,
A furtive look you know as well,
And Nicodemus' mystery
Receives its annual reply.





X.

THE SLEEPING FLOWERS.

"Whose are the little beds," I asked,
"Which in the valleys lie?"
Some shook their heads, and others smiled,
And no one made reply.

"Perhaps they did not hear," I said;
"I will inquire again.
Whose are the beds, the tiny beds
So thick upon the plain?"

"'T is daisy in the shortest;
A little farther on,
Nearest the door to wake the first,
Little leontodon.

"'T is iris, sir, and aster,
Anemone and bell,
Batschia in the blanket red,
And chubby daffodil."

Meanwhile at many cradles
Her busy foot she plied,
Humming the quaintest lullaby
That ever rocked a child.

"Hush! Epigea wakens! --
The crocus stirs her lids,
Rhodora's cheek is crimson, --
She's dreaming of the woods."

Then, turning from them, reverent,
"Their bed-time 't is," she said;
"The bumble-bees will wake them
When April woods are red."





XI.

MY ROSE.

Pigmy seraphs gone astray,
Velvet people from Vevay,
Belles from some lost summer day,
Bees' exclusive coterie.
Paris could not lay the fold
Belted down with emerald;
Venice could not show a cheek
Of a tint so lustrous meek.
Never such an ambuscade
As of brier and leaf displayed
For my little damask maid.
I had rather wear her grace
Than an earl's distinguished face;
I had rather dwell like her
Than be Duke of Exeter
Royalty enough for me
To subdue the bumble-bee!





XII.

THE ORIOLE'S SECRET.

To hear an oriole sing
May be a common thing,
Or only a divine.

It is not of the bird
Who sings the same, unheard,
As unto crowd.

The fashion of the ear
Attireth that it hear
In dun or fair.

So whether it be rune,
Or whether it be none,
Is of within;

The "tune is in the tree,"
The sceptic showeth me;
"No, sir! In thee!"





XIII.

THE ORIOLE.

One of the ones that Midas touched,
Who failed to touch us all,
Was that confiding prodigal,
The blissful oriole.

So drunk, he disavows it
With badinage divine;
So dazzling, we mistake him
For an alighting mine.

A pleader, a dissembler,
An epicure, a thief, --
Betimes an oratorio,
An ecstasy in chief;

The Jesuit of orchards,
He cheats as he enchants
Of an entire attar
For his decamping wants.

The splendor of a Burmah,
The meteor of birds,
Departing like a pageant
Of ballads and of bards.

I never thought that Jason sought
For any golden fleece;
But then I am a rural man,
With thoughts that make for peace.

But if there were a Jason,
Tradition suffer me
Behold his lost emolument
Upon the apple-tree.





XIV.

IN SHADOW.

I dreaded that first robin so,
But he is mastered now,
And I 'm accustomed to him grown, --
He hurts a little, though.

I thought if I could only live
Till that first shout got by,
Not all pianos in the woods
Had power to mangle me.

I dared not meet the daffodils,
For fear their yellow gown
Would pierce me with a fashion
So foreign to my own.

I wished the grass would hurry,
So when 't was time to see,
He 'd be too tall, the tallest one
Could stretch to look at me.

I could not bear the bees should come,
I wished they 'd stay away
In those dim countries where they go:
What word had they for me?

They 're here, though; not a creature failed,
No blossom stayed away
In gentle deference to me,
The Queen of Calvary.

Each one salutes me as he goes,
And I my childish plumes
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment
Of their unthinking drums.





XV.

THE HUMMING-BIRD.

A route of evanescence
With a revolving wheel;
A resonance of emerald,
A rush of cochineal;
And every blossom on the bush
Adjusts its tumbled head, --
The mail from Tunis, probably,
An easy morning's ride.





XVI.

SECRETS.

The skies can't keep their secret!
They tell it to the hills --
The hills just tell the orchards --
And they the daffodils!

A bird, by chance, that goes that way
Soft overheard the whole.
If I should bribe the little bird,
Who knows but she would tell?

I think I won't, however,
It's finer not to know;
If summer were an axiom,
What sorcery had snow?

So keep your secret, Father!
I would not, if I could,
Know what the sapphire fellows do,
In your new-fashioned world!





XVII.

Who robbed the woods,
The trusting woods?
The unsuspecting trees
Brought out their burrs and mosses
His fantasy to please.
He scanned their trinkets, curious,
He grasped, he bore away.
What will the solemn hemlock,
What will the fir-tree say?





XVIII.

TWO VOYAGERS.

Two butterflies went out at noon
And waltzed above a stream,
Then stepped straight through the firmament
And rested on a beam;

And then together bore away
Upon a shining sea, --
Though never yet, in any port,
Their coming mentioned be.

If spoken by the distant bird,
If met in ether sea
By frigate or by merchantman,
Report was not to me.





XIX.

BY THE SEA.

I started early, took my dog,
And visited the sea;
The mermaids in the basement
Came out to look at me,

And frigates in the upper floor
Extended hempen hands,
Presuming me to be a mouse
Aground, upon the sands.

But no man moved me till the tide
Went past my simple shoe,
And past my apron and my belt,
And past my bodice too,

And made as he would eat me up
As wholly as a dew
Upon a dandelion's sleeve --
And then I started too.

And he -- he followed close behind;
I felt his silver heel
Upon my ankle, -- then my shoes
Would overflow with pearl.

Until we met the solid town,
No man he seemed to know;
And bowing with a mighty look
At me, the sea withdrew.





XX.

OLD-FASHIONED.

Arcturus is his other name, --
I'd rather call him star!
It's so unkind of science
To go and interfere!

I pull a flower from the woods, --
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath,
And has her in a class.

Whereas I took the butterfly
Aforetime in my hat,
He sits erect in cabinets,
The clover-bells forgot.

What once was heaven, is zenith now.
Where I proposed to go
When time's brief masquerade was done,
Is mapped, and charted too!

What if the poles should frisk about
And stand upon their heads!
I hope I 'm ready for the worst,
Whatever prank betides!

Perhaps the kingdom of Heaven 's changed!
I hope the children there
Won't be new-fashioned when I come,
And laugh at me, and stare!

I hope the father in the skies
Will lift his little girl, --
Old-fashioned, naughty, everything, --
Over the stile of pearl!





XXI.

A TEMPEST.

An awful tempest mashed the air,
The clouds were gaunt and few;
A black, as of a spectre's cloak,
Hid heaven and earth from view.

The creatures chuckled on the roofs
And whistled in the air,
And shook their fists and gnashed their teeth.
And swung their frenzied hair.

The morning lit, the birds arose;
The monster's faded eyes
Turned slowly to his native coast,
And peace was Paradise!





XXII.

THE SEA.

An everywhere of silver,
With ropes of sand
To keep it from effacing
The track called land.





XXIII.

IN THE GARDEN.

A bird came down the walk:
He did not know I saw;
He bit an angle-worm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw.

And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass,
And then hopped sidewise to the wall
To let a beetle pass.

He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all abroad, --
They looked like frightened beads, I thought;
He stirred his velvet head

Like one in danger; cautious,
I offered him a crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers
And rowed him softer home

Than oars divide the ocean,
Too silver for a seam,
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,
Leap, plashless, as they swim.





XXIV.

THE SNAKE.

A narrow fellow in the grass
Occasionally rides;
You may have met him, -- did you not,
His notice sudden is.

The grass divides as with a comb,
A spotted shaft is seen;
And then it closes at your feet
And opens further on.

He likes a boggy acre,
A floor too cool for corn.
Yet when a child, and barefoot,
I more than once, at morn,

Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash
Unbraiding in the sun, --
When, stooping to secure it,
It wrinkled, and was gone.

Several of nature's people
I know, and they know me;
I feel for them a transport
Of cordiality;

But never met this fellow,
Attended or alone,
Without a tighter breathing,
And zero at the bone.





XXV.

THE MUSHROOM.

The mushroom is the elf of plants,
At evening it is not;
At morning in a truffled hut
It stops upon a spot

As if it tarried always;
And yet its whole career
Is shorter than a snake's delay,
And fleeter than a tare.

'T is vegetation's juggler,
The germ of alibi;
Doth like a bubble antedate,
And like a bubble hie.

I feel as if the grass were pleased
To have it intermit;
The surreptitious scion
Of summer's circumspect.

Had nature any outcast face,
Could she a son contemn,
Had nature an Iscariot,
That mushroom, -- it is him.





XXVI.

THE STORM.

There came a wind like a bugle;
It quivered through the grass,
And a green chill upon the heat
So ominous did pass
We barred the windows and the doors
As from an emerald ghost;
The doom's electric moccason
That very instant passed.
On a strange mob of panting trees,
And fences fled away,
And rivers where the houses ran
The living looked that day.
The bell within the steeple wild
The flying tidings whirled.
How much can come
And much can go,
And yet abide the world!





XXVII.

THE SPIDER.

A spider sewed at night
Without a light
Upon an arc of white.
If ruff it was of dame
Or shroud of gnome,
Himself, himself inform.
Of immortality
His strategy
Was physiognomy.





XXVIII.

I know a place where summer strives
With such a practised frost,
She each year leads her daisies back,
Recording briefly, "Lost."

But when the south wind stirs the pools
And struggles in the lanes,
Her heart misgives her for her vow,
And she pours soft refrains

Into the lap of adamant,
And spices, and the dew,
That stiffens quietly to quartz,
Upon her amber shoe.





XXIX.

The one that could repeat the summer day
Were greater than itself, though he
Minutest of mankind might be.
And who could reproduce the sun,
At period of going down --
The lingering and the stain, I mean --
When Orient has been outgrown,
And Occident becomes unknown,
His name remain.





XXX.

THE WlND'S VISIT.

The wind tapped like a tired man,
And like a host, "Come in,"
I boldly answered; entered then
My residence within

A rapid, footless guest,
To offer whom a chair
Were as impossible as hand
A sofa to the air.

No bone had he to bind him,
His speech was like the push
Of numerous humming-birds at once
From a superior bush.

His countenance a billow,
His fingers, if he pass,
Let go a music, as of tunes
Blown tremulous in glass.

He visited, still flitting;
Then, like a timid man,
Again he tapped -- 't was flurriedly --
And I became alone.





XXXI.

Nature rarer uses yellow
   Than another hue;
Saves she all of that for sunsets, --
   Prodigal of blue,

Spending scarlet like a woman,
   Yellow she affords
Only scantly and selectly,
   Like a lover's words.





XXXII.

GOSSIP.

The leaves, like women, interchange
  Sagacious confidence;
Somewhat of nods, and somewhat of
  Portentous inference,

The parties in both cases
  Enjoining secrecy, --
Inviolable compact
  To notoriety.





XXXIII.

SIMPLICITY.

How happy is the little stone
That rambles in the road alone,
And doesn't care about careers,
And exigencies never fears;
Whose coat of elemental brown
A passing universe put on;
And independent as the sun,
Associates or glows alone,
Fulfilling absolute decree
In casual simplicity.





XXXIV.

STORM.

It sounded as if the streets were running,
And then the streets stood still.
Eclipse was all we could see at the window,
And awe was all we could feel.

By and by the boldest stole out of his covert,
To see if time was there.
Nature was in her beryl apron,
Mixing fresher air.





XXXV.

THE RAT.

The rat is the concisest tenant.
He pays no rent, --
Repudiates the obligation,
On schemes intent.

Balking our wit
To sound or circumvent,
Hate cannot harm
A foe so reticent.

Neither decree
Prohibits him,
Lawful as
Equilibrium.





XXXVI.

Frequently the woods are pink,
Frequently are brown;
Frequently the hills undress
Behind my native town.

Oft a head is crested
I was wont to see,
And as oft a cranny
Where it used to be.

And the earth, they tell me,
On its axis turned, --
Wonderful rotation
By but twelve performed!





XXXVII.

A THUNDER-STORM.

The wind begun to rock the grass
With threatening tunes and low, --
He flung a menace at the earth,
A menace at the sky.

The leaves unhooked themselves from trees
And started all abroad;
The dust did scoop itself like hands
And throw away the road.

The wagons quickened on the streets,
The thunder hurried slow;
The lightning showed a yellow beak,
And then a livid claw.

The birds put up the bars to nests,
The cattle fled to barns;
There came one drop of giant rain,
And then, as if the hands

That held the dams had parted hold,
The waters wrecked the sky,
But overlooked my father's house,
Just quartering a tree.





XXXVIII.

WITH FLOWERS.

South winds jostle them,
Bumblebees come,
Hover, hesitate,
Drink, and are gone.

Butterflies pause
On their passage Cashmere;
I, softly plucking,
Present them here!





XXXIX.

SUNSET.

Where ships of purple gently toss
On seas of daffodil,
Fantastic sailors mingle,
And then -- the wharf is still.





XL.

She sweeps with many-colored brooms,
And leaves the shreds behind;
Oh, housewife in the evening west,
Come back, and dust the pond!

You dropped a purple ravelling in,
You dropped an amber thread;
And now you 've littered all the East
With duds of emerald!

And still she plies her spotted brooms,
And still the aprons fly,
Till brooms fade softly into stars --
And then I come away.





XLI.

Like mighty footlights burned the red
At bases of the trees, --
The far theatricals of day
Exhibiting to these.

'T was universe that did applaud
While, chiefest of the crowd,
Enabled by his royal dress,
Myself distinguished God.





XLII.

PROBLEMS.

Bring me the sunset in a cup,
Reckon the morning's flagons up,
   And say how many dew;
Tell me how far the morning leaps,
Tell me what time the weaver sleeps
   Who spun the breadths of blue!

Write me how many notes there be
In the new robin's ecstasy
   Among astonished boughs;
How many trips the tortoise makes,
How many cups the bee partakes, --
   The debauchee of dews!

Also, who laid the rainbow's piers,
Also, who leads the docile spheres
   By withes of supple blue?
Whose fingers string the stalactite,
Who counts the wampum of the night,
   To see that none is due?

Who built this little Alban house
And shut the windows down so close
   My spirit cannot see?
Who 'll let me out some gala day,
With implements to fly away,
   Passing pomposity?





XLIII.

THE JUGGLER OF DAY.

Blazing in gold and quenching in purple,
Leaping like leopards to the sky,
Then at the feet of the old horizon
Laying her spotted face, to die;

Stooping as low as the otter's window,
Touching the roof and tinting the barn,
Kissing her bonnet to the meadow, --
And the juggler of day is gone!




XLIV.

MY CRICKET.

Farther in summer than the birds,
Pathetic from the grass,
A minor nation celebrates
Its unobtrusive mass.

No ordinance is seen,
So gradual the grace,
A pensive custom it becomes,
Enlarging loneliness.

Antiquest felt at noon
When August, burning low,
Calls forth this spectral canticle,
Repose to typify.

Remit as yet no grace,
No furrow on the glow,
Yet a druidic difference
Enhances nature now.




XLV.

As imperceptibly as grief
The summer lapsed away, --
Too imperceptible, at last,
To seem like perfidy.

A quietness distilled,
As twilight long begun,
Or Nature, spending with herself
Sequestered afternoon.

The dusk drew earlier in,
The morning foreign shone, --
A courteous, yet harrowing grace,
As guest who would be gone.

And thus, without a wing,
Or service of a keel,
Our summer made her light escape
Into the beautiful.





XLVI.

It can't be summer, -- that got through;
It 's early yet for spring;
There 's that long town of white to cross
Before the blackbirds sing.

It can't be dying, -- it's too rouge, --
The dead shall go in white.
So sunset shuts my question down
With clasps of chrysolite.





XLVII.

SUMMER'S OBSEQUIES.

The gentian weaves her fringes,
The maple's loom is red.
My departing blossoms
Obviate parade.

A brief, but patient illness,
An hour to prepare;
And one, below this morning,
Is where the angels are.

It was a short procession, --
The bobolink was there,
An aged bee addressed us,
And then we knelt in prayer.

We trust that she was willing, --
We ask that we may be.
Summer, sister, seraph,
Let us go with thee!

In the name of the bee
And of the butterfly
And of the breeze, amen!





XLVIII.

FRINGED GENTIAN.

God made a little gentian;
It tried to be a rose
And failed, and all the summer laughed.
But just before the snows
There came a purple creature
That ravished all the hill;
And summer hid her forehead,
And mockery was still.
The frosts were her condition;
The Tyrian would not come
Until the North evoked it.
"Creator! shall I bloom?"





XLIX.

NOVEMBER.

Besides the autumn poets sing,
A few prosaic days
A little this side of the snow
And that side of the haze.

A few incisive mornings,
A few ascetic eyes, --
Gone Mr. Bryant's golden-rod,
And Mr. Thomson's sheaves.

Still is the bustle in the brook,
Sealed are the spicy valves;
Mesmeric fingers softly touch
The eyes of many elves.

Perhaps a squirrel may remain,
My sentiments to share.
Grant me, O Lord, a sunny mind,
Thy windy will to bear!





L.

THE SNOW.

It sifts from leaden sieves,
It powders all the wood,
It fills with alabaster wool
The wrinkles of the road.

It makes an even face
Of mountain and of plain, --
Unbroken forehead from the east
Unto the east again.

It reaches to the fence,
It wraps it, rail by rail,
Till it is lost in fleeces;
It flings a crystal veil

On stump and stack and stem, --
The summer's empty room,
Acres of seams where harvests were,
Recordless, but for them.

It ruffles wrists of posts,
As ankles of a queen, --
Then stills its artisans like ghosts,
Denying they have been.





LI.

THE BLUE JAY.

No brigadier throughout the year
So civic as the jay.
A neighbor and a warrior too,
With shrill felicity

Pursuing winds that censure us
A February day,
The brother of the universe
Was never blown away.

The snow and he are intimate;
I 've often seen them play
When heaven looked upon us all
With such severity,

I felt apology were due
To an insulted sky,
Whose pompous frown was nutriment
To their temerity.

The pillow of this daring head
Is pungent evergreens;
His larder -- terse and militant --
Unknown, refreshing things;

His character a tonic,
His future a dispute;
Unfair an immortality
That leaves this neighbor out.






IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.


I.

Let down the bars, O Death!
The tired flocks come in
Whose bleating ceases to repeat,
Whose wandering is done.

Thine is the stillest night,
Thine the securest fold;
Too near thou art for seeking thee,
Too tender to be told.





II.

Going to heaven!
I don't know when,
Pray do not ask me how, --
Indeed, I 'm too astonished
To think of answering you!
Going to heaven! --
How dim it sounds!
And yet it will be done
As sure as flocks go home at night
Unto the shepherd's arm!

Perhaps you 're going too!
Who knows?
If you should get there first,
Save just a little place for me
Close to the two I lost!

The smallest "robe" will fit me,
And just a bit of "crown;"
For you know we do not mind our dress
When we are going home.

I 'm glad I don't believe it,
For it would stop my breath,
And I 'd like to look a little more
At such a curious earth!
I am glad they did believe it
Whom I have never found
Since the mighty autumn afternoon
I left them in the ground.





III.

At least to pray is left, is left.
O Jesus! in the air
I know not which thy chamber is, --
I 'm knocking everywhere.

Thou stirrest earthquake in the South,
And maelstrom in the sea;
Say, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
Hast thou no arm for me?





IV.

EPITAPH.

Step lightly on this narrow spot!
The broadest land that grows
Is not so ample as the breast
These emerald seams enclose.

Step lofty; for this name is told
As far as cannon dwell,
Or flag subsist, or fame export
Her deathless syllable.





V.

Morns like these we parted;
Noons like these she rose,
Fluttering first, then firmer,
To her fair repose.

Never did she lisp it,
And 't was not for me;
She was mute from transport,
I, from agony!

Till the evening, nearing,
One the shutters drew --
Quick! a sharper rustling!
And this linnet flew!





VI.

A death-blow is a life-blow to some
Who, till they died, did not alive become;
Who, had they lived, had died, but when
They died, vitality begun.





VII.

I read my sentence steadily,
Reviewed it with my eyes,
To see that I made no mistake
In its extremest clause, --

The date, and manner of the shame;
And then the pious form
That "God have mercy" on the soul
The jury voted him.

I made my soul familiar
With her extremity,
That at the last it should not be
A novel agony,

But she and Death, acquainted,
Meet tranquilly as friends,
Salute and pass without a hint --
And there the matter ends.





VIII.

I have not told my garden yet,
Lest that should conquer me;
I have not quite the strength now
To break it to the bee.

I will not name it in the street,
For shops would stare, that I,
So shy, so very ignorant,
Should have the face to die.

The hillsides must not know it,
Where I have rambled so,
Nor tell the loving forests
The day that I shall go,

Nor lisp it at the table,
Nor heedless by the way
Hint that within the riddle
One will walk to-day!





IX.

THE BATTLE-FIELD.

They dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,
   Like petals from a rose,
When suddenly across the June
   A wind with fingers goes.

They perished in the seamless grass, --
   No eye could find the place;
But God on his repealless list
   Can summon every face.





X.

The only ghost I ever saw
Was dressed in mechlin, -- so;
He wore no sandal on his foot,
And stepped like flakes of snow.
His gait was soundless, like the bird,
But rapid, like the roe;
His fashions quaint, mosaic,
Or, haply, mistletoe.

His conversation seldom,
His laughter like the breeze
That dies away in dimples
Among the pensive trees.
Our interview was transient,--
Of me, himself was shy;
And God forbid I look behind
Since that appalling day!





XI.

Some, too fragile for winter winds,
The thoughtful grave encloses, --
Tenderly tucking them in from frost
Before their feet are cold.

Never the treasures in her nest
The cautious grave exposes,
Building where schoolboy dare not look
And sportsman is not bold.

This covert have all the children
Early aged, and often cold, --
Sparrows unnoticed by the Father;
Lambs for whom time had not a fold.





XII.

As by the dead we love to sit,
Become so wondrous dear,
As for the lost we grapple,
Though all the rest are here, --

In broken mathematics
We estimate our prize,
Vast, in its fading ratio,
To our penurious eyes!





XIII.

MEMORIALS.

Death sets a thing significant
The eye had hurried by,
Except a perished creature
Entreat us tenderly

To ponder little workmanships
In crayon or in wool,
With "This was last her fingers did,"
Industrious until

The thimble weighed too heavy,
The stitches stopped themselves,
And then 't was put among the dust
Upon the closet shelves.

A book I have, a friend gave,
Whose pencil, here and there,
Had notched the place that pleased him, --
At rest his fingers are.

Now, when I read, I read not,
For interrupting tears
Obliterate the etchings
Too costly for repairs.





XIV.

I went to heaven, --
'T was a small town,
Lit with a ruby,
Lathed with down.
Stiller than the fields
At the full dew,
Beautiful as pictures
No man drew.
People like the moth,
Of mechlin, frames,
Duties of gossamer,
And eider names.
Almost contented
I could be
'Mong such unique
Society.





XV.

Their height in heaven comforts not,
Their glory nought to me;
'T was best imperfect, as it was;
I 'm finite, I can't see.

The house of supposition,
The glimmering frontier
That skirts the acres of perhaps,
To me shows insecure.

The wealth I had contented me;
If 't was a meaner size,
Then I had counted it until
It pleased my narrow eyes

Better than larger values,
However true their show;
This timid life of evidence
Keeps pleading, "I don't know."





XVI.

There is a shame of nobleness
Confronting sudden pelf, --
A finer shame of ecstasy
Convicted of itself.

A best disgrace a brave man feels,
Acknowledged of the brave, --
One more "Ye Blessed" to be told;
But this involves the grave.





XVII.

TRIUMPH.

Triumph may be of several kinds.
There 's triumph in the room
When that old imperator, Death,
By faith is overcome.

There 's triumph of the finer mind
When truth, affronted long,
Advances calm to her supreme,
Her God her only throng.

A triumph when temptation's bribe
Is slowly handed back,
One eye upon the heaven renounced
And one upon the rack.

Severer triumph, by himself
Experienced, who can pass
Acquitted from that naked bar,
Jehovah's countenance!





XVIII.

Pompless no life can pass away;
    The lowliest career
To the same pageant wends its way
    As that exalted here.
How cordial is the mystery!
    The hospitable pall
A "this way" beckons spaciously, --
    A miracle for all!





XIX.

I noticed people disappeared,
When but a little child, --
Supposed they visited remote,
Or settled regions wild.

Now know I they both visited
And settled regions wild,
But did because they died, -- a fact
Withheld the little child!





XX.

FOLLOWING.

I had no cause to be awake,
My best was gone to sleep,
And morn a new politeness took,
And failed to wake them up,

But called the others clear,
And passed their curtains by.
Sweet morning, when I over-sleep,
Knock, recollect, for me!

I looked at sunrise once,
And then I looked at them,
And wishfulness in me arose
For circumstance the same.

'T was such an ample peace,
It could not hold a sigh, --
'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,
'T was sunset all the day.

So choosing but a gown
And taking but a prayer,
The only raiment I should need,
I struggled, and was there.





XXI.

If anybody's friend be dead,
It 's sharpest of the theme
The thinking how they walked alive,
At such and such a time.

Their costume, of a Sunday,
Some manner of the hair, --
A prank nobody knew but them,
Lost, in the sepulchre.

How warm they were on such a day:
You almost feel the date,
So short way off it seems; and now,
They 're centuries from that.

How pleased they were at what you said;
You try to touch the smile,
And dip your fingers in the frost:
When was it, can you tell,

You asked the company to tea,
Acquaintance, just a few,
And chatted close with this grand thing
That don't remember you?

Past bows and invitations,
Past interview, and vow,
Past what ourselves can estimate, --
That makes the quick of woe!





XXII.

THE JOURNEY.

Our journey had advanced;
Our feet were almost come
To that odd fork in Being's road,
Eternity by term.

Our pace took sudden awe,
Our feet reluctant led.
Before were cities, but between,
The forest of the dead.

Retreat was out of hope, --
Behind, a sealed route,
Eternity's white flag before,
And God at every gate.





XXIII.

A COUNTRY BURIAL.

Ample make this bed.
Make this bed with awe;
In it wait till judgment break
Excellent and fair.

Be its mattress straight,
Be its pillow round;
Let no sunrise' yellow noise
Interrupt this ground.





XXIV.

GOING.

On such a night, or such a night,
Would anybody care
If such a little figure
Slipped quiet from its chair,

So quiet, oh, how quiet!
That nobody might know
But that the little figure
Rocked softer, to and fro?

On such a dawn, or such a dawn,
Would anybody sigh
That such a little figure
Too sound asleep did lie

For chanticleer to wake it, --
Or stirring house below,
Or giddy bird in orchard,
Or early task to do?

There was a little figure plump
For every little knoll,
Busy needles, and spools of thread,
And trudging feet from school.

Playmates, and holidays, and nuts,
And visions vast and small.
Strange that the feet so precious charged
Should reach so small a goal!





XXV.

Essential oils are wrung:
The attar from the rose
Is not expressed by suns alone,
It is the gift of screws.

The general rose decays;
But this, in lady's drawer,
Makes summer when the lady lies
In ceaseless rosemary.




XXVI.

I lived on dread; to those who know
The stimulus there is
In danger, other impetus
Is numb and vital-less.

As 't were a spur upon the soul,
A fear will urge it where
To go without the spectre's aid
Were challenging despair.





XXVII.

If I should die,
And you should live,
And time should gurgle on,
And morn should beam,
And noon should burn,
As it has usual done;
If birds should build as early,
And bees as bustling go, --
One might depart at option
From enterprise below!
'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand
When we with daisies lie,
That commerce will continue,
And trades as briskly fly.
It makes the parting tranquil
And keeps the soul serene,
That gentlemen so sprightly
Conduct the pleasing scene!





XXVIII.

AT LENGTH.

Her final summer was it,
And yet we guessed it not;
If tenderer industriousness
Pervaded her, we thought

A further force of life
Developed from within, --
When Death lit all the shortness up,
And made the hurry plain.

We wondered at our blindness, --
When nothing was to see
But her Carrara guide-post, --
At our stupidity,

When, duller than our dulness,
The busy darling lay,
So busy was she, finishing,
So leisurely were we!





XXIX.

GHOSTS.

One need not be a chamber to be haunted,
One need not be a house;
The brain has corridors surpassing
Material place.

Far safer, of a midnight meeting
External ghost,
Than an interior confronting
That whiter host.

Far safer through an Abbey gallop,
The stones achase,
Than, moonless, one's own self encounter
In lonesome place.

Ourself, behind ourself concealed,
Should startle most;
Assassin, hid in our apartment,
Be horror's least.

The prudent carries a revolver,
He bolts the door,
O'erlooking a superior spectre
More near.





XXX.

VANISHED.

She died, -- this was the way she died;
And when her breath was done,
Took up her simple wardrobe
And started for the sun.

Her little figure at the gate
The angels must have spied,
Since I could never find her
Upon the mortal side.





XXXI.

PRECEDENCE.

Wait till the majesty of Death
Invests so mean a brow!
Almost a powdered footman
Might dare to touch it now!

Wait till in everlasting robes
This democrat is dressed,
Then prate about "preferment"
And "station" and the rest!

Around this quiet courtier
Obsequious angels wait!
Full royal is his retinue,
Full purple is his state!

A lord might dare to lift the hat
To such a modest clay,
Since that my Lord, "the Lord of lords"
Receives unblushingly!





XXXII.

GONE.

Went up a year this evening!
I recollect it well!
Amid no bells nor bravos
The bystanders will tell!
Cheerful, as to the village,
Tranquil, as to repose,
Chastened, as to the chapel,
This humble tourist rose.
Did not talk of returning,
Alluded to no time
When, were the gales propitious,
We might look for him;
Was grateful for the roses
In life's diverse bouquet,
Talked softly of new species
To pick another day.

Beguiling thus the wonder,
The wondrous nearer drew;
Hands bustled at the moorings --
The crowd respectful grew.
Ascended from our vision
To countenances new!
A difference, a daisy,
Is all the rest I knew!





XXXIII.

REQUIEM.

Taken from men this morning,
Carried by men to-day,
Met by the gods with banners
Who marshalled her away.

One little maid from playmates,
One little mind from school, --
There must be guests in Eden;
All the rooms are full.

Far as the east from even,
Dim as the border star, --
Courtiers quaint, in kingdoms,
Our departed are.





XXXIV.

What inn is this
Where for the night
Peculiar traveller comes?
Who is the landlord?
Where the maids?
Behold, what curious rooms!
No ruddy fires on the hearth,
No brimming tankards flow.
Necromancer, landlord,
Who are these below?





XXXV.

It was not death, for I stood up,
And all the dead lie down;
It was not night, for all the bells
Put out their tongues, for noon.

It was not frost, for on my flesh
I felt siroccos crawl, --
Nor fire, for just my marble feet
Could keep a chancel cool.

And yet it tasted like them all;
The figures I have seen
Set orderly, for burial,
Reminded me of mine,

As if my life were shaven
And fitted to a frame,
And could not breathe without a key;
And 't was like midnight, some,

When everything that ticked has stopped,
And space stares, all around,
Or grisly frosts, first autumn morns,
Repeal the beating ground.

But most like chaos, -- stopless, cool, --
Without a chance or spar,
Or even a report of land
To justify despair.





XXXVI.

TILL THE END.

I should not dare to leave my friend,
Because -- because if he should die
While I was gone, and I -- too late --
Should reach the heart that wanted me;

If I should disappoint the eyes
That hunted, hunted so, to see,
And could not bear to shut until
They "noticed" me -- they noticed me;

If I should stab the patient faith
So sure I 'd come -- so sure I 'd come,
It listening, listening, went to sleep
Telling my tardy name, --

My heart would wish it broke before,
Since breaking then, since breaking then,
Were useless as next morning's sun,
Where midnight frosts had lain!





XXXVII.

VOID.

Great streets of silence led away
To neighborhoods of pause;
Here was no notice, no dissent,
No universe, no laws.

By clocks 't was morning, and for night
The bells at distance called;
But epoch had no basis here,
For period exhaled.





XXXVIII.

A throe upon the features
A hurry in the breath,
An ecstasy of parting
Denominated "Death," --

An anguish at the mention,
Which, when to patience grown,
I 've known permission given
To rejoin its own.





XXXIX.

SAVED!

Of tribulation these are they
Denoted by the white;
The spangled gowns, a lesser rank
Of victors designate.

All these did conquer; but the ones
Who overcame most times
Wear nothing commoner than snow,
No ornament but palms.

Surrender is a sort unknown
On this superior soil;
Defeat, an outgrown anguish,
Remembered as the mile

Our panting ankle barely gained
When night devoured the road;
But we stood whispering in the house,
And all we said was "Saved"!





XL.

I think just how my shape will rise
When I shall be forgiven,
Till hair and eyes and timid head
Are out of sight, in heaven.

I think just how my lips will weigh
With shapeless, quivering prayer
That you, so late, consider me,
The sparrow of your care.

I mind me that of anguish sent,
Some drifts were moved away
Before my simple bosom broke, --
And why not this, if they?

And so, until delirious borne
I con that thing, -- "forgiven," --
Till with long fright and longer trust
I drop my heart, unshriven!





XLI.

THE FORGOTTEN GRAVE.

After a hundred years
Nobody knows the place, --
Agony, that enacted there,
Motionless as peace.

Weeds triumphant ranged,
Strangers strolled and spelled
At the lone orthography
Of the elder dead.

Winds of summer fields
Recollect the way, --
Instinct picking up the key
Dropped by memory.





XLII.

Lay this laurel on the one
Too intrinsic for renown.
Laurel! veil your deathless tree, --
Him you chasten, that is he!








POEMS

by EMILY DICKINSON

Third Series




Edited by

MABEL LOOMIS TODD



    It's all I have to bring to-day,
      This, and my heart beside,
    This, and my heart, and all the fields,
      And all the meadows wide.
    Be sure you count, should I forget, --
      Some one the sum could tell, --
    This, and my heart, and all the bees
      Which in the clover dwell.



PREFACE.

The intellectual activity of Emily Dickinson was so great that
a large and characteristic choice is still possible among her
literary material, and this third volume of her verses is put
forth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of her
peculiar genius. Much of Emily Dickinson's prose was rhythmic,
--even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines.

Also many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in
letters; these were published in 1894, in the volumes of her
_Letters_. It has not been necessary, however, to include them in
this Series, and all have been omitted, except three or four
exceptionally strong ones, as "A Book," and "With Flowers."

There is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply
spontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward
circumstance. Others, however, had an obvious personal origin;
for example, the verses "I had a Guinea golden," which seem to
have been sent to some friend travelling in Europe, as a dainty
reminder of letter-writing delinquencies. The surroundings in
which any of Emily Dickinson's verses are known to have been
written usually serve to explain them clearly; but in general the
present volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation to
those who apprehend this scintillating spirit.

AMHERST, _October_, 1896.




I. LIFE.


I.

REAL RICHES.

'T is little I could care for pearls
  Who own the ample sea;
Or brooches, when the Emperor
  With rubies pelteth me;

Or gold, who am the Prince of Mines;
  Or diamonds, when I see
A diadem to fit a dome
  Continual crowning me.





II.

SUPERIORITY TO FATE.

Superiority to fate
  Is difficult to learn.
'T is not conferred by any,
  But possible to earn

A pittance at a time,
  Until, to her surprise,
The soul with strict economy
  Subsists till Paradise.





III.

HOPE.

Hope is a subtle glutton;
  He feeds upon the fair;
And yet, inspected closely,
  What abstinence is there!

His is the halcyon table
  That never seats but one,
And whatsoever is consumed
  The same amounts remain.





IV.

FORBIDDEN FRUIT.

I.

Forbidden fruit a flavor has
  That lawful orchards mocks;
How luscious lies the pea within
  The pod that Duty locks!





V.

FORBIDDEN FRUIT.

II.

Heaven is what I cannot reach!
  The apple on the tree,
Provided it do hopeless hang,
  That 'heaven' is, to me.

The color on the cruising cloud,
  The interdicted ground
Behind the hill, the house behind, --
  There Paradise is found!





VI.

A WORD.

A word is dead
When it is said,
  Some say.
I say it just
Begins to live
  That day.





VII.

To venerate the simple days
  Which lead the seasons by,
Needs but to remember
  That from you or me
They may take the trifle
  Termed mortality!

To invest existence with a stately air,
Needs but to remember
  That the acorn there
Is the egg of forests
  For the upper air!





VIII.

LIFE'S TRADES.

It's such a little thing to weep,
  So short a thing to sigh;
And yet by trades the size of these
  We men and women die!





IX.

Drowning is not so pitiful
  As the attempt to rise.
Three times, 't is said, a sinking man
  Comes up to face the skies,
And then declines forever
  To that abhorred abode
Where hope and he part company, --
  For he is grasped of God.
The Maker's cordial visage,
  However good to see,
Is shunned, we must admit it,
  Like an adversity.





X.

How still the bells in steeples stand,
  Till, swollen with the sky,
They leap upon their silver feet
  In frantic melody!





XI.

If the foolish call them 'flowers,'
  Need the wiser tell?
If the savans 'classify' them,
  It is just as well!

Those who read the Revelations
  Must not criticise
Those who read the same edition
  With beclouded eyes!

Could we stand with that old Moses
  Canaan denied, --
Scan, like him, the stately landscape
  On the other side, --

Doubtless we should deem superfluous
  Many sciences
Not pursued by learnd angels
  In scholastic skies!

Low amid that glad _Belles lettres_
  Grant that we may stand,
Stars, amid profound Galaxies,
  At that grand 'Right hand'!





XII.

A SYLLABLE.

Could mortal lip divine
  The undeveloped freight
Of a delivered syllable,
  'T would crumble with the weight.





XIII.

PARTING.

My life closed twice before its close;
  It yet remains to see
If Immortality unveil
  A third event to me,

So huge, so hopeless to conceive,
  As these that twice befell.
Parting is all we know of heaven,
  And all we need of hell.





XIV.

ASPIRATION.

We never know how high we are
  Till we are called to rise;
And then, if we are true to plan,
  Our statures touch the skies.

The heroism we recite
  Would be a daily thing,
Did not ourselves the cubits warp
  For fear to be a king.





XV.

THE INEVITABLE.

While I was fearing it, it came,
  But came with less of fear,
Because that fearing it so long
  Had almost made it dear.
There is a fitting a dismay,
  A fitting a despair.
'Tis harder knowing it is due,
  Than knowing it is here.
The trying on the utmost,
  The morning it is new,
Is terribler than wearing it
  A whole existence through.





XVI.

A BOOK.

There is no frigate like a book
  To take us lands away,
Nor any coursers like a page
  Of prancing poetry.
This traverse may the poorest take
  Without oppress of toll;
How frugal is the chariot
  That bears a human soul!





XVII.

Who has not found the heaven below
  Will fail of it above.
God's residence is next to mine,
  His furniture is love.





XVIII.

A PORTRAIT.

A face devoid of love or grace,
  A hateful, hard, successful face,
A face with which a stone
  Would feel as thoroughly at ease
As were they old acquaintances, --
  First time together thrown.





XIX.

I HAD A GUINEA GOLDEN.

I had a guinea golden;
  I lost it in the sand,
And though the sum was simple,
  And pounds were in the land,
Still had it such a value
  Unto my frugal eye,
That when I could not find it
  I sat me down to sigh.

I had a crimson robin
  Who sang full many a day,
But when the woods were painted
  He, too, did fly away.
Time brought me other robins, --
  Their ballads were the same, --
Still for my missing troubadour
  I kept the 'house at hame.'

I had a star in heaven;
  One Pleiad was its name,
And when I was not heeding
  It wandered from the same.
And though the skies are crowded,
  And all the night ashine,
I do not care about it,
  Since none of them are mine.

My story has a moral:
  I have a missing friend, --
Pleiad its name, and robin,
  And guinea in the sand, --
And when this mournful ditty,
  Accompanied with tear,
Shall meet the eye of traitor
  In country far from here,
Grant that repentance solemn
  May seize upon his mind,
And he no consolation
  Beneath the sun may find.

NOTE. -- This poem may have had, like many others, a
personal origin. It is more than probable that it was
sent to some friend travelling in Europe, a dainty
reminder of letter-writing delinquencies.





XX.

SATURDAY AFTERNOON.

From all the jails the boys and girls
  Ecstatically leap, --
Beloved, only afternoon
  That prison doesn't keep.

They storm the earth and stun the air,
  A mob of solid bliss.
Alas! that frowns could lie in wait
  For such a foe as this!






XXI.

Few get enough, -- enough is one;
  To that ethereal throng
Have not each one of us the right
  To stealthily belong?





XXII.

Upon the gallows hung a wretch,
  Too sullied for the hell
To which the law entitled him.
  As nature's curtain fell
The one who bore him tottered in,
  For this was woman's son.
''T was all I had,' she stricken gasped;
  Oh, what a livid boon!





XXIII.

THE LOST THOUGHT.

I felt a clearing in my mind
  As if my brain had split;
I tried to match it, seam by seam,
  But could not make them fit.

The thought behind I strove to join
  Unto the thought before,
But sequence ravelled out of reach
  Like balls upon a floor.





XXIV.

RETICENCE.

The reticent volcano keeps
  His never slumbering plan;
Confided are his projects pink
  To no precarious man.

If nature will not tell the tale
  Jehovah told to her,
Can human nature not survive
  Without a listener?

Admonished by her buckled lips
  Let every babbler be.
The only secret people keep
  Is Immortality.





XXV.

WITH FLOWERS.

If recollecting were forgetting,
  Then I remember not;
And if forgetting, recollecting,
  How near I had forgot!
And if to miss were merry,
  And if to mourn were gay,
How very blithe the fingers
  That gathered these to-day!





XXVI.

The farthest thunder that I heard
  Was nearer than the sky,
And rumbles still, though torrid noons
  Have lain their missiles by.
The lightning that preceded it
  Struck no one but myself,
But I would not exchange the bolt
  For all the rest of life.
Indebtedness to oxygen
  The chemist may repay,
But not the obligation
  To electricity.
It founds the homes and decks the days,
  And every clamor bright
Is but the gleam concomitant
  Of that waylaying light.
The thought is quiet as a flake, --
  A crash without a sound;
How life's reverberation
  Its explanation found!





XXVII.

On the bleakness of my lot
  Bloom I strove to raise.
Late, my acre of a rock
  Yielded grape and maize.

Soil of flint if steadfast tilled
  Will reward the hand;
Seed of palm by Lybian sun
  Fructified in sand.





XXVIII.

CONTRAST.

A door just opened on a street --
  I, lost, was passing by --
An instant's width of warmth disclosed,
  And wealth, and company.

The door as sudden shut, and I,
  I, lost, was passing by, --
Lost doubly, but by contrast most,
  Enlightening misery.






XXIX.

FRIENDS.

Are friends delight or pain?
  Could bounty but remain
Riches were good.

But if they only stay
Bolder to fly away,
  Riches are sad.






XXX.

FIRE.

Ashes denote that fire was;
  Respect the grayest pile
For the departed creature's sake
  That hovered there awhile.

Fire exists the first in light,
  And then consolidates, --
Only the chemist can disclose
  Into what carbonates.





XXXI.

A MAN.

Fate slew him, but he did not drop;
  She felled -- he did not fall --
Impaled him on her fiercest stakes --
  He neutralized them all.

She stung him, sapped his firm advance,
  But, when her worst was done,
And he, unmoved, regarded her,
  Acknowledged him a man.





XXXII.

VENTURES.

Finite to fail, but infinite to venture.
  For the one ship that struts the shore
Many's the gallant, overwhelmed creature
  Nodding in navies nevermore.





XXXIII.

GRIEFS.

I measure every grief I meet
  With analytic eyes;
I wonder if it weighs like mine,
  Or has an easier size.

I wonder if they bore it long,
  Or did it just begin?
I could not tell the date of mine,
  It feels so old a pain.

I wonder if it hurts to live,
  And if they have to try,
And whether, could they choose between,
  They would not rather die.

I wonder if when years have piled --
  Some thousands -- on the cause
Of early hurt, if such a lapse
  Could give them any pause;

Or would they go on aching still
  Through centuries above,
Enlightened to a larger pain
  By contrast with the love.

The grieved are many, I am told;
  The reason deeper lies, --
Death is but one and comes but once,
  And only nails the eyes.

There's grief of want, and grief of cold, --
  A sort they call 'despair;'
There's banishment from native eyes,
  In sight of native air.

And though I may not guess the kind
  Correctly, yet to me
A piercing comfort it affords
  In passing Calvary,

To note the fashions of the cross,
  Of those that stand alone,
Still fascinated to presume
  That some are like my own.





XXXIV.

I have a king who does not speak;
So, wondering, thro' the hours meek
  I trudge the day away,--
Half glad when it is night and sleep,
If, haply, thro' a dream to peep
  In parlors shut by day.

And if I do, when morning comes,
It is as if a hundred drums
  Did round my pillow roll,
And shouts fill all my childish sky,
And bells keep saying 'victory'
  From steeples in my soul!

And if I don't, the little Bird
Within the Orchard is not heard,
  And I omit to pray,
'Father, thy will be done' to-day,
For my will goes the other way,
  And it were perjury!





XXXV.

DISENCHANTMENT.

It dropped so low in my regard
  I heard it hit the ground,
And go to pieces on the stones
  At bottom of my mind;

Yet blamed the fate that fractured, less
  Than I reviled myself
For entertaining plated wares
  Upon my silver shelf.





XXXVI.

LOST FAITH.

To lose one's faith surpasses
  The loss of an estate,
Because estates can be
  Replenished, -- faith cannot.

Inherited with life,
  Belief but once can be;
Annihilate a single clause,
  And Being's beggary.





XXXVII.

LOST JOY.

I had a daily bliss
  I half indifferent viewed,
Till sudden I perceived it stir, --
  It grew as I pursued,

Till when, around a crag,
  It wasted from my sight,
Enlarged beyond my utmost scope,
  I learned its sweetness right.





XXXVIII.

I worked for chaff, and earning wheat
  Was haughty and betrayed.
What right had fields to arbitrate
  In matters ratified?

I tasted wheat, -- and hated chaff,
  And thanked the ample friend;
Wisdom is more becoming viewed
  At distance than at hand.





XXXIX.

Life, and Death, and Giants
  Such as these, are still.
Minor apparatus, hopper of the mill,
Beetle at the candle,
  Or a fife's small fame,
Maintain by accident
  That they proclaim.





XL.

ALPINE GLOW.

Our lives are Swiss, --
  So still, so cool,
  Till, some odd afternoon,
The Alps neglect their curtains,
  And we look farther on.

Italy stands the other side,
  While, like a guard between,
The solemn Alps,
The siren Alps,
  Forever intervene!





XLI.

REMEMBRANCE.

Remembrance has a rear and front, --
  'T is something like a house;
It has a garret also
  For refuse and the mouse,

Besides, the deepest cellar
  That ever mason hewed;
Look to it, by its fathoms
  Ourselves be not pursued.





XLII.

To hang our head ostensibly,
  And subsequent to find
That such was not the posture
  Of our immortal mind,

Affords the sly presumption
  That, in so dense a fuzz,
You, too, take cobweb attitudes
  Upon a plane of gauze!





XLIII.

THE BRAIN.

The brain is wider than the sky,
  For, put them side by side,
The one the other will include
  With ease, and you beside.

The brain is deeper than the sea,
  For, hold them, blue to blue,
The one the other will absorb,
  As sponges, buckets do.

The brain is just the weight of God,
  For, lift them, pound for pound,
And they will differ, if they do,
  As syllable from sound.





XLIV.

The bone that has no marrow;
  What ultimate for that?
It is not fit for table,
  For beggar, or for cat.

A bone has obligations,
  A being has the same;
A marrowless assembly
  Is culpabler than shame.

But how shall finished creatures
  A function fresh obtain? --
Old Nicodemus' phantom
  Confronting us again!





XLV.

THE PAST.

The past is such a curious creature,
  To look her in the face
A transport may reward us,
  Or a disgrace.

Unarmed if any meet her,
  I charge him, fly!
Her rusty ammunition
  Might yet reply!





XLVI.

To help our bleaker parts
  Salubrious hours are given,
Which if they do not fit for earth
  Drill silently for heaven.





XLVII.

What soft, cherubic creatures
  These gentlewomen are!
One would as soon assault a plush
  Or violate a star.

Such dimity convictions,
  A horror so refined
Of freckled human nature,
  Of Deity ashamed, --

It's such a common glory,
  A fisherman's degree!
Redemption, brittle lady,
  Be so, ashamed of thee.





XLVIII.

DESIRE.

Who never wanted, -- maddest joy
  Remains to him unknown:
The banquet of abstemiousness
  Surpasses that of wine.

Within its hope, though yet ungrasped
  Desire's perfect goal,
No nearer, lest reality
  Should disenthrall thy soul.





XLIX.

PHILOSOPHY.

It might be easier
  To fail with land in sight,
Than gain my blue peninsula
  To perish of delight.





L.

POWER.

You cannot put a fire out;
  A thing that can ignite
Can go, itself, without a fan
  Upon the slowest night.

You cannot fold a flood
  And put it in a drawer, --
Because the winds would find it out,
  And tell your cedar floor.





LI.

A modest lot, a fame petite,
  A brief campaign of sting and sweet
  Is plenty! Is enough!
A sailor's business is the shore,
  A soldier's -- balls. Who asketh more
Must seek the neighboring life!





LII.

Is bliss, then, such abyss
I must not put my foot amiss
For fear I spoil my shoe?

I'd rather suit my foot
Than save my boot,
For yet to buy another pair
Is possible
At any fair.

But bliss is sold just once;
The patent lost
None buy it any more.





LIII.

EXPERIENCE.

I stepped from plank to plank
  So slow and cautiously;
The stars about my head I felt,
  About my feet the sea.

I knew not but the next
  Would be my final inch, --
This gave me that precarious gait
  Some call experience.





LIV.

THANKSGIVING DAY.

One day is there of the series
  Termed Thanksgiving day,
Celebrated part at table,
  Part in memory.

Neither patriarch nor pussy,
  I dissect the play;
Seems it, to my hooded thinking,
  Reflex holiday.

Had there been no sharp subtraction
  From the early sum,
Not an acre or a caption
  Where was once a room,

Not a mention, whose small pebble
  Wrinkled any bay, --
Unto such, were such assembly,
  'T were Thanksgiving day.





LV.

CHILDISH GRIEFS.

Softened by Time's consummate plush,
  How sleek the woe appears
That threatened childhood's citadel
  And undermined the years!

Bisected now by bleaker griefs,
  We envy the despair
That devastated childhood's realm,
  So easy to repair.






II. LOVE.


I.

CONSECRATION.

Proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it,
  Proud of the pain I did not feel till thee,
Proud of my night since thou with moons dost slake it,
  Not to partake thy passion, my humility.





II.

LOVE'S HUMILITY.

My worthiness is all my doubt,
  His merit all my fear,
Contrasting which, my qualities
  Do lowlier appear;

Lest I should insufficient prove
  For his beloved need,
The chiefest apprehension
  Within my loving creed.

So I, the undivine abode
  Of his elect content,
Conform my soul as 't were a church
  Unto her sacrament.





III.

LOVE.

Love is anterior to life,
  Posterior to death,
Initial of creation, and
  The exponent of breath.





IV.

SATISFIED.

One blessing had I, than the rest
  So larger to my eyes
That I stopped gauging, satisfied,
  For this enchanted size.

It was the limit of my dream,
  The focus of my prayer, --
A perfect, paralyzing bliss
  Contented as despair.

I knew no more of want or cold,
  Phantasms both become,
For this new value in the soul,
  Supremest earthly sum.

The heaven below the heaven above
  Obscured with ruddier hue.
Life's latitude leant over-full;
  The judgment perished, too.

Why joys so scantily disburse,
  Why Paradise defer,
Why floods are served to us in bowls, --
  I speculate no more.





V.

WITH A FLOWER.

When roses cease to bloom, dear,
  And violets are done,
When bumble-bees in solemn flight
  Have passed beyond the sun,

The hand that paused to gather
  Upon this summer's day
Will idle lie, in Auburn, --
  Then take my flower, pray!





VI.

SONG.

Summer for thee grant I may be
  When summer days are flown!
Thy music still when whippoorwill
  And oriole are done!

For thee to bloom, I'll skip the tomb
  And sow my blossoms o'er!
Pray gather me, Anemone,
  Thy flower forevermore!





VII.

LOYALTY.

Split the lark and you'll find the music,
  Bulb after bulb, in silver rolled,
Scantily dealt to the summer morning,
  Saved for your ear when lutes be old.

Loose the flood, you shall find it patent,
  Gush after gush, reserved for you;
Scarlet experiment! sceptic Thomas,
  Now, do you doubt that your bird was true?





VIII.

To lose thee, sweeter than to gain
  All other hearts I knew.
'T is true the drought is destitute,
  But then I had the dew!

The Caspian has its realms of sand,
  Its other realm of sea;
Without the sterile perquisite
  No Caspian could be.





IX.

  Poor little heart!
  Did they forget thee?
Then dinna care! Then dinna care!

  Proud little heart!
  Did they forsake thee?
Be debonair! Be debonair!

  Frail little heart!
  I would not break thee:
Could'st credit me? Could'st credit me?

  Gay little heart!
  Like morning glory
Thou'll wilted be; thou'll wilted be!





X.

FORGOTTEN.

There is a word
  Which bears a sword
  Can pierce an armed man.
It hurls its barbed syllables,--
  At once is mute again.
But where it fell
The saved will tell
  On patriotic day,
Some epauletted brother
  Gave his breath away.

Wherever runs the breathless sun,
  Wherever roams the day,
There is its noiseless onset,
  There is its victory!

Behold the keenest marksman!
  The most accomplished shot!
Time's sublimest target
  Is a soul 'forgot'!





XI.

I've got an arrow here;
  Loving the hand that sent it,
I the dart revere.

Fell, they will say, in 'skirmish'!
  Vanquished, my soul will know,
By but a simple arrow
  Sped by an archer's bow.





XII.

THE MASTER.

He fumbles at your spirit
  As players at the keys
Before they drop full music on;
  He stuns you by degrees,

Prepares your brittle substance
  For the ethereal blow,
By fainter hammers, further heard,
  Then nearer, then so slow

Your breath has time to straighten,
  Your brain to bubble cool, --
Deals one imperial thunderbolt
  That scalps your naked soul.





XIII.

Heart, we will forget him!
  You and I, to-night!
You may forget the warmth he gave,
  I will forget the light.

When you have done, pray tell me,
  That I my thoughts may dim;
Haste! lest while you're lagging,
  I may remember him!





XIV.

Father, I bring thee not myself, --
  That were the little load;
I bring thee the imperial heart
  I had not strength to hold.

The heart I cherished in my own
  Till mine too heavy grew,
Yet strangest, heavier since it went,
  Is it too large for you?





XV.

We outgrow love like other things
  And put it in the drawer,
Till it an antique fashion shows
  Like costumes grandsires wore.





XVI.

Not with a club the heart is broken,
    Nor with a stone;
A whip, so small you could not see it.
    I've known

To lash the magic creature
    Till it fell,
Yet that whip's name too noble
    Then to tell.

Magnanimous of bird
    By boy descried,
To sing unto the stone
    Of which it died.





XVII.

WHO?

My friend must be a bird,
    Because it flies!
Mortal my friend must be,
    Because it dies!
Barbs has it, like a bee.
Ah, curious friend,
    Thou puzzlest me!





XVIII.

He touched me, so I live to know
That such a day, permitted so,
  I groped upon his breast.
It was a boundless place to me,
And silenced, as the awful sea
  Puts minor streams to rest.

And now, I'm different from before,
As if I breathed superior air,
  Or brushed a royal gown;
My feet, too, that had wandered so,
My gypsy face transfigured now
  To tenderer renown.





XIX.

DREAMS.

Let me not mar that perfect dream
  By an auroral stain,
But so adjust my daily night
  That it will come again.





XX.

NUMEN LUMEN.

I live with him, I see his face;
  I go no more away
For visitor, or sundown;
  Death's single privacy,

The only one forestalling mine,
  And that by right that he
Presents a claim invisible,
  No wedlock granted me.

I live with him, I hear his voice,
  I stand alive to-day
To witness to the certainty
  Of immortality

Taught me by Time, -- the lower way,
  Conviction every day, --
That life like this is endless,
  Be judgment what it may.





XXI.

LONGING.

I envy seas whereon he rides,
  I envy spokes of wheels
Of chariots that him convey,
  I envy speechless hills

That gaze upon his journey;
  How easy all can see
What is forbidden utterly
  As heaven, unto me!

I envy nests of sparrows
  That dot his distant eaves,
The wealthy fly upon his pane,
  The happy, happy leaves

That just abroad his window
  Have summer's leave to be,
The earrings of Pizarro
  Could not obtain for me.

I envy light that wakes him,
  And bells that boldly ring
To tell him it is noon abroad, --
  Myself his noon could bring,

Yet interdict my blossom
  And abrogate my bee,
Lest noon in everlasting night
  Drop Gabriel and me.





XXII.

WEDDED.

A solemn thing it was, I said,
  A woman white to be,
And wear, if God should count me fit,
  Her hallowed mystery.

A timid thing to drop a life
  Into the purple well,
Too plummetless that it come back
  Eternity until.









III. NATURE.


I.

NATURE'S CHANGES.

The springtime's pallid landscape
  Will glow like bright bouquet,
Though drifted deep in parian
  The village lies to-day.

The lilacs, bending many a year,
  With purple load will hang;
The bees will not forget the tune
  Their old forefathers sang.

The rose will redden in the bog,
  The aster on the hill
Her everlasting fashion set,
  And covenant gentians frill,

Till summer folds her miracle
  As women do their gown,
Or priests adjust the symbols
  When sacrament is done.





II.

THE TULIP.

She slept beneath a tree
  Remembered but by me.
I touched her cradle mute;
She recognized the foot,
Put on her carmine suit, --
  And see!





III.

A light exists in spring
  Not present on the year
At any other period.
  When March is scarcely here

A color stands abroad
  On solitary hills
That science cannot overtake,
  But human nature feels.

It waits upon the lawn;
  It shows the furthest tree
Upon the furthest slope we know;
  It almost speaks to me.

Then, as horizons step,
  Or noons report away,
Without the formula of sound,
  It passes, and we stay:

A quality of loss
  Affecting our content,
As trade had suddenly encroached
  Upon a sacrament.





IV.

THE WAKING YEAR.

A lady red upon the hill
  Her annual secret keeps;
A lady white within the field
  In placid lily sleeps!

The tidy breezes with their brooms
  Sweep vale, and hill, and tree!
Prithee, my pretty housewives!
  Who may expected be?

The neighbors do not yet suspect!
  The woods exchange a smile --
Orchard, and buttercup, and bird --
  In such a little while!

And yet how still the landscape stands,
  How nonchalant the wood,
As if the resurrection
  Were nothing very odd!





V.

TO MARCH.

Dear March, come in!
How glad I am!
I looked for you before.
Put down your hat --
You must have walked --
How out of breath you are!
Dear March, how are you?
And the rest?
Did you leave Nature well?
Oh, March, come right upstairs with me,
I have so much to tell!

I got your letter, and the birds';
The maples never knew
That you were coming, -- I declare,
How red their faces grew!
But, March, forgive me --
And all those hills
You left for me to hue;
There was no purple suitable,
You took it all with you.

Who knocks? That April!
Lock the door!
I will not be pursued!
He stayed away a year, to call
When I am occupied.
But trifles look so trivial
As soon as you have come,
That blame is just as dear as praise
And praise as mere as blame.





VI.

MARCH.

We like March, his shoes are purple,
  He is new and high;
Makes he mud for dog and peddler,
  Makes he forest dry;
Knows the adder's tongue his coming,
  And begets her spot.
Stands the sun so close and mighty
  That our minds are hot.
News is he of all the others;
  Bold it were to die
With the blue-birds buccaneering
  On his British sky.




VII.

DAWN.

Not knowing when the dawn will come
  I open every door;
Or has it feathers like a bird,
  Or billows like a shore?





VIII.

A murmur in the trees to note,
  Not loud enough for wind;
A star not far enough to seek,
  Nor near enough to find;

A long, long yellow on the lawn,
  A hubbub as of feet;
Not audible, as ours to us,
  But dapperer, more sweet;

A hurrying home of little men
  To houses unperceived, --
All this, and more, if I should tell,
  Would never be believed.

Of robins in the trundle bed
  How many I espy
Whose nightgowns could not hide the wings,
  Although I heard them try!

But then I promised ne'er to tell;
  How could I break my word?
So go your way and I'll go mine, --
  No fear you'll miss the road.





IX.

Morning is the place for dew,
  Corn is made at noon,
After dinner light for flowers,
  Dukes for setting sun!





X.

To my quick ear the leaves conferred;
  The bushes they were bells;
I could not find a privacy
  From Nature's sentinels.

In cave if I presumed to hide,
  The walls began to tell;
Creation seemed a mighty crack
  To make me visible.





XI.

A ROSE.

A sepal, petal, and a thorn
  Upon a common summer's morn,
A flash of dew, a bee or two,
A breeze
A caper in the trees, --
  And I'm a rose!





XII.

High from the earth I heard a bird;
  He trod upon the trees
As he esteemed them trifles,
  And then he spied a breeze,
And situated softly
  Upon a pile of wind
Which in a perturbation
  Nature had left behind.
A joyous-going fellow
  I gathered from his talk,
Which both of benediction
  And badinage partook,
Without apparent burden,
  I learned, in leafy wood
He was the faithful father
  Of a dependent brood;
And this untoward transport
  His remedy for care, --
A contrast to our respites.
  How different we are!





XIII.

COBWEBS.

The spider as an artist
  Has never been employed
Though his surpassing merit
  Is freely certified

By every broom and Bridget
  Throughout a Christian land.
Neglected son of genius,
  I take thee by the hand.





XIV.

A WELL.

What mystery pervades a well!
  The water lives so far,
Like neighbor from another world
  Residing in a jar.

The grass does not appear afraid;
  I often wonder he
Can stand so close and look so bold
  At what is dread to me.

Related somehow they may be, --
  The sedge stands next the sea,
Where he is floorless, yet of fear
  No evidence gives he.

But nature is a stranger yet;
  The ones that cite her most
Have never passed her haunted house,
  Nor simplified her ghost.

To pity those that know her not
  Is helped by the regret
That those who know her, know her less
  The nearer her they get.





XV.

To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, --
One clover, and a bee,
And revery.
The revery alone will do
If bees are few.





XVI.

THE WIND.

It's like the light, --
  A fashionless delight
It's like the bee, --
  A dateless melody.

It's like the woods,
  Private like breeze,
Phraseless, yet it stirs
  The proudest trees.

It's like the morning, --
  Best when it's done, --
The everlasting clocks
  Chime noon.





XVII.

A dew sufficed itself
  And satisfied a leaf,
And felt, 'how vast a destiny!
  How trivial is life!'

The sun went out to work,
  The day went out to play,
But not again that dew was seen
  By physiognomy.

Whether by day abducted,
  Or emptied by the sun
Into the sea, in passing,
  Eternally unknown.





XVIII.

THE WOODPECKER.

His bill an auger is,
  His head, a cap and frill.
He laboreth at every tree, --
  A worm his utmost goal.





XIX.

A SNAKE.

Sweet is the swamp with its secrets,
  Until we meet a snake;
'T is then we sigh for houses,
  And our departure take
At that enthralling gallop
  That only childhood knows.
A snake is summer's treason,
  And guile is where it goes.





XX.

Could I but ride indefinite,
  As doth the meadow-bee,
And visit only where I liked,
  And no man visit me,

And flirt all day with buttercups,
  And marry whom I may,
And dwell a little everywhere,
  Or better, run away

With no police to follow,
  Or chase me if I do,
Till I should jump peninsulas
  To get away from you, --

I said, but just to be a bee
  Upon a raft of air,
And row in nowhere all day long,
  And anchor off the bar,--
What liberty! So captives deem
  Who tight in dungeons are.





XXI.

THE MOON.

The moon was but a chin of gold
  A night or two ago,
And now she turns her perfect face
  Upon the world below.

Her forehead is of amplest blond;
  Her cheek like beryl stone;
Her eye unto the summer dew
  The likest I have known.

Her lips of amber never part;
  But what must be the smile
Upon her friend she could bestow
  Were such her silver will!

And what a privilege to be
  But the remotest star!
For certainly her way might pass
  Beside your twinkling door.

Her bonnet is the firmament,
  The universe her shoe,
The stars the trinkets at her belt,
  Her dimities of blue.





XXII.

THE BAT.

The bat is dun with wrinkled wings
  Like fallow article,
And not a song pervades his lips,
  Or none perceptible.

His small umbrella, quaintly halved,
  Describing in the air
An arc alike inscrutable, --
  Elate philosopher!

Deputed from what firmament
  Of what astute abode,
Empowered with what malevolence
  Auspiciously withheld.

To his adroit Creator
  Ascribe no less the praise;
Beneficent, believe me,
  His eccentricities.





XXIII.

THE BALLOON.

You've seen balloons set, haven't you?
  So stately they ascend
It is as swans discarded you
  For duties diamond.

Their liquid feet go softly out
  Upon a sea of blond;
They spurn the air as 't were too mean
  For creatures so renowned.

Their ribbons just beyond the eye,
  They struggle some for breath,
And yet the crowd applauds below;
  They would not encore death.

The gilded creature strains and spins,
  Trips frantic in a tree,
Tears open her imperial veins
  And tumbles in the sea.

The crowd retire with an oath
  The dust in streets goes down,
And clerks in counting-rooms observe,
  ''T was only a balloon.'





XXIV.

EVENING.

The cricket sang,
And set the sun,
And workmen finished, one by one,
  Their seam the day upon.

The low grass loaded with the dew,
The twilight stood as strangers do
With hat in hand, polite and new,
  To stay as if, or go.

A vastness, as a neighbor, came, --
A wisdom without face or name,
A peace, as hemispheres at home, --
  And so the night became.





XXV.

COCOON.

Drab habitation of whom?
Tabernacle or tomb,
Or dome of worm,
Or porch of gnome,
Or some elf's catacomb?




XXVI.

SUNSET.

A sloop of amber slips away
  Upon an ether sea,
And wrecks in peace a purple tar,
  The son of ecstasy.





XXVII.

AURORA.

Of bronze and blaze
  The north, to-night!
  So adequate its forms,
So preconcerted with itself,
  So distant to alarms, --
An unconcern so sovereign
  To universe, or me,
It paints my simple spirit
  With tints of majesty,
Till I take vaster attitudes,
  And strut upon my stem,
Disdaining men and oxygen,
  For arrogance of them.

My splendors are menagerie;
  But their competeless show
Will entertain the centuries
  When I am, long ago,
An island in dishonored grass,
  Whom none but daisies know.





XXVIII.

THE COMING OF NIGHT.

How the old mountains drip with sunset,
  And the brake of dun!
How the hemlocks are tipped in tinsel
  By the wizard sun!

How the old steeples hand the scarlet,
  Till the ball is full, --
Have I the lip of the flamingo
  That I dare to tell?

Then, how the fire ebbs like billows,
  Touching all the grass
With a departing, sapphire feature,
  As if a duchess pass!

How a small dusk crawls on the village
  Till the houses blot;
And the odd flambeaux no men carry
  Glimmer on the spot!

Now it is night in nest and kennel,
  And where was the wood,
Just a dome of abyss is nodding
  Into solitude! --

These are the visions baffled Guido;
  Titian never told;
Domenichino dropped the pencil,
  Powerless to unfold.





XXIX.

AFTERMATH.

The murmuring of bees has ceased;
  But murmuring of some
Posterior, prophetic,
  Has simultaneous come, --

The lower metres of the year,
  When nature's laugh is done, --
The Revelations of the book
  Whose Genesis is June.






IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.

I.

This world is not conclusion;
  A sequel stands beyond,
Invisible, as music,
  But positive, as sound.
It beckons and it baffles;
  Philosophies don't know,
And through a riddle, at the last,
  Sagacity must go.
To guess it puzzles scholars;
  To gain it, men have shown
Contempt of generations,
  And crucifixion known.





II.

We learn in the retreating
  How vast an one
Was recently among us.
  A perished sun

Endears in the departure
  How doubly more
Than all the golden presence
  It was before!





III.

They say that 'time assuages,' --
  Time never did assuage;
An actual suffering strengthens,
  As sinews do, with age.

Time is a test of trouble,
  But not a remedy.
If such it prove, it prove too
  There was no malady.





IV.

We cover thee, sweet face.
  Not that we tire of thee,
But that thyself fatigue of us;
  Remember, as thou flee,
We follow thee until
  Thou notice us no more,
And then, reluctant, turn away
  To con thee o'er and o'er,
And blame the scanty love
  We were content to show,
Augmented, sweet, a hundred fold
  If thou would'st take it now.





V.

ENDING.

That is solemn we have ended, --
  Be it but a play,
Or a glee among the garrets,
  Or a holiday,

Or a leaving home; or later,
  Parting with a world
We have understood, for better
  Still it be unfurled.





VI.

The stimulus, beyond the grave
  His countenance to see,
Supports me like imperial drams
  Afforded royally.





VII.

Given in marriage unto thee,
  Oh, thou celestial host!
Bride of the Father and the Son,
  Bride of the Holy Ghost!

Other betrothal shall dissolve,
  Wedlock of will decay;
Only the keeper of this seal
  Conquers mortality.






VIII.

That such have died enables us
  The tranquiller to die;
That such have lived, certificate
  For immortality.





IX.

They won't frown always, -- some sweet day
  When I forget to tease,
They'll recollect how cold I looked,
  And how I just said 'please.'

Then they will hasten to the door
  To call the little child,
Who cannot thank them, for the ice
  That on her lisping piled.





X.

IMMORTALITY.

It is an honorable thought,
  And makes one lift one's hat,
As one encountered gentlefolk
  Upon a daily street,

That we've immortal place,
  Though pyramids decay,
And kingdoms, like the orchard,
  Flit russetly away.





XI.

The distance that the dead have gone
  Does not at first appear;
Their coming back seems possible
  For many an ardent year.

And then, that we have followed them
  We more than half suspect,
So intimate have we become
  With their dear retrospect.





XII.

How dare the robins sing,
  When men and women hear
Who since they went to their account
  Have settled with the year! --
Paid all that life had earned
  In one consummate bill,
And now, what life or death can do
  Is immaterial.
Insulting is the sun
  To him whose mortal light,
Beguiled of immortality,
  Bequeaths him to the night.
In deference to him
  Extinct be every hum,
Whose garden wrestles with the dew,
  At daybreak overcome!





XIII.

DEATH.

Death is like the insect
  Menacing the tree,
Competent to kill it,
  But decoyed may be.

Bait it with the balsam,
  Seek it with the knife,
Baffle, if it cost you
  Everything in life.

Then, if it have burrowed
  Out of reach of skill,
Ring the tree and leave it, --
  'T is the vermin's will.





XIV.

UNWARNED.

'T is sunrise, little maid, hast thou
  No station in the day?
'T was not thy wont to hinder so, --
  Retrieve thine industry.

'T is noon, my little maid, alas!
  And art thou sleeping yet?
The lily waiting to be wed,
  The bee, dost thou forget?

My little maid, 't is night; alas,
  That night should be to thee
Instead of morning! Hadst thou broached
  Thy little plan to me,
Dissuade thee if I could not, sweet,
  I might have aided thee.





XV.

Each that we lose takes part of us;
  A crescent still abides,
Which like the moon, some turbid night,
  Is summoned by the tides.





XVI.

Not any higher stands the grave
  For heroes than for men;
Not any nearer for the child
  Than numb three-score and ten.

This latest leisure equal lulls
  The beggar and his queen;
Propitiate this democrat
  By summer's gracious mien.





XVII.

ASLEEP.

As far from pity as complaint,
  As cool to speech as stone,
As numb to revelation
  As if my trade were bone.

As far from time as history,
  As near yourself to-day
As children to the rainbow's scarf,
  Or sunset's yellow play

To eyelids in the sepulchre.
  How still the dancer lies,
While color's revelations break,
  And blaze the butterflies!





XVIII.

THE SPIRIT.

'T is whiter than an Indian pipe,
  'T is dimmer than a lace;
No stature has it, like a fog,
  When you approach the place.

Not any voice denotes it here,
  Or intimates it there;
A spirit, how doth it accost?
  What customs hath the air?

This limitless hyperbole
  Each one of us shall be;
'T is drama, if (hypothesis)
  It be not tragedy!





XIX.

THE MONUMENT.

She laid her docile crescent down,
  And this mechanic stone
Still states, to dates that have forgot,
  The news that she is gone.

So constant to its stolid trust,
  The shaft that never knew,
It shames the constancy that fled
  Before its emblem flew.





XX.

Bless God, he went as soldiers,
  His musket on his breast;
Grant, God, he charge the bravest
  Of all the martial blest.

Please God, might I behold him
  In epauletted white,
I should not fear the foe then,
  I should not fear the fight.





XXI.

Immortal is an ample word
  When what we need is by,
But when it leaves us for a time,
  'T is a necessity.

Of heaven above the firmest proof
  We fundamental know,
Except for its marauding hand,
  It had been heaven below.





XXII.

Where every bird is bold to go,
  And bees abashless play,
The foreigner before he knocks
  Must thrust the tears away.





XXIII.

The grave my little cottage is,
  Where, keeping house for thee,
I make my parlor orderly,
  And lay the marble tea,

For two divided, briefly,
  A cycle, it may be,
Till everlasting life unite
  In strong society.





XXIV.

This was in the white of the year,
  That was in the green,
Drifts were as difficult then to think
  As daisies now to be seen.

Looking back is best that is left,
  Or if it be before,
Retrospection is prospect's half,
  Sometimes almost more.





XXV.

Sweet hours have perished here;
  This is a mighty room;
Within its precincts hopes have played, --
  Now shadows in the tomb.





XXVI.

Me! Come! My dazzled face
In such a shining place!

Me! Hear! My foreign ear
The sounds of welcome near!

The saints shall meet
Our bashful feet.

My holiday shall be
That they remember me;

My paradise, the fame
That they pronounce my name.





XXVII.

INVISIBLE.

From us she wandered now a year,
  Her tarrying unknown;
If wilderness prevent her feet,
  Or that ethereal zone

No eye hath seen and lived,
  We ignorant must be.
We only know what time of year
  We took the mystery.






XXVIII.

I wish I knew that woman's name,
  So, when she comes this way,
To hold my life, and hold my ears,
  For fear I hear her say

She's 'sorry I am dead,' again,
  Just when the grave and I
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep, --
  Our only lullaby.





XXIX.

TRYING TO FORGET.

Bereaved of all, I went abroad,
  No less bereaved to be
Upon a new peninsula, --
  The grave preceded me,

Obtained my lodgings ere myself,
  And when I sought my bed,
The grave it was, reposed upon
  The pillow for my head.

I waked, to find it first awake,
  I rose, -- it followed me;
I tried to drop it in the crowd,
  To lose it in the sea,

In cups of artificial drowse
  To sleep its shape away, --
The grave was finished, but the spade
  Remained in memory.





XXX.

I felt a funeral in my brain,
  And mourners, to and fro,
Kept treading, treading, till it seemed
  That sense was breaking through.

And when they all were seated,
  A service like a drum
Kept beating, beating, till I thought
  My mind was going numb.

And then I heard them lift a box,
  And creak across my soul
With those same boots of lead, again.
  Then space began to toll

As all the heavens were a bell,
  And Being but an ear,
And I and silence some strange race,
  Wrecked, solitary, here.





XXXI.

I meant to find her when I came;
  Death had the same design;
But the success was his, it seems,
  And the discomfit mine.

I meant to tell her how I longed
  For just this single time;
But Death had told her so the first,
  And she had hearkened him.

To wander now is my abode;
  To rest, -- to rest would be
A privilege of hurricane
  To memory and me.





XXXII.

WAITING.

I sing to use the waiting,
  My bonnet but to tie,
And shut the door unto my house;
  No more to do have I,

Till, his best step approaching,
  We journey to the day,
And tell each other how we sang
  To keep the dark away.





XXXIII.

A sickness of this world it most occasions
  When best men die;
A wishfulness their far condition
  To occupy.

A chief indifference, as foreign
  A world must be
Themselves forsake contented,
  For Deity.





XXXIV.

Superfluous were the sun
  When excellence is dead;
He were superfluous every day,
  For every day is said

That syllable whose faith
  Just saves it from despair,
And whose 'I'll meet you' hesitates
  If love inquire, 'Where?'

Upon his dateless fame
  Our periods may lie,
As stars that drop anonymous
  From an abundant sky.





XXXV.

So proud she was to die
  It made us all ashamed
That what we cherished, so unknown
  To her desire seemed.

So satisfied to go
  Where none of us should be,
Immediately, that anguish stooped
  Almost to jealousy.





XXXVI.

FAREWELL.

Tie the strings to my life, my Lord,
  Then I am ready to go!
Just a look at the horses --
  Rapid! That will do!

Put me in on the firmest side,
  So I shall never fall;
For we must ride to the Judgment,
  And it's partly down hill.

But never I mind the bridges,
  And never I mind the sea;
Held fast in everlasting race
  By my own choice and thee.

Good-by to the life I used to live,
  And the world I used to know;
And kiss the hills for me, just once;
  Now I am ready to go!





XXXVII.

The dying need but little, dear, --
  A glass of water's all,
A flower's unobtrusive face
  To punctuate the wall,

A fan, perhaps, a friend's regret,
  And certainly that one
No color in the rainbow
  Perceives when you are gone.





XXXVIII.

DEAD.

There's something quieter than sleep
  Within this inner room!
It wears a sprig upon its breast,
  And will not tell its name.

Some touch it and some kiss it,
  Some chafe its idle hand;
It has a simple gravity
  I do not understand!

While simple-hearted neighbors
  Chat of the 'early dead,'
We, prone to periphrasis,
  Remark that birds have fled!





XXXIX.

The soul should always stand ajar,
  That if the heaven inquire,
He will not be obliged to wait,
  Or shy of troubling her.

Depart, before the host has slid
  The bolt upon the door,
To seek for the accomplished guest, --
  Her visitor no more.





XL.

Three weeks passed since I had seen her, --
  Some disease had vexed;
'T was with text and village singing
  I beheld her next,

And a company -- our pleasure
  To discourse alone;
Gracious now to me as any,
  Gracious unto none.

Borne, without dissent of either,
  To the parish night;
Of the separated people
  Which are out of sight?





XLI.

I breathed enough to learn the trick,
  And now, removed from air,
I simulate the breath so well,
  That one, to be quite sure

The lungs are stirless, must descend
  Among the cunning cells,
And touch the pantomime himself.
  How cool the bellows feels!





XLII.

I wonder if the sepulchre
  Is not a lonesome way,
When men and boys, and larks and June
  Go down the fields to hay!





XLIII.

JOY IN DEATH.

If tolling bell I ask the cause.
  'A soul has gone to God,'
I'm answered in a lonesome tone;
  Is heaven then so sad?

That bells should joyful ring to tell
  A soul had gone to heaven,
Would seem to me the proper way
  A good news should be given.





XLIV.

If I may have it when it's dead
  I will contented be;
If just as soon as breath is out
  It shall belong to me,

Until they lock it in the grave,
  'T is bliss I cannot weigh,
For though they lock thee in the grave,
  Myself can hold the key.

Think of it, lover! I and thee
  Permitted face to face to be;
After a life, a death we'll say, --
  For death was that, and this is thee.





XLV.

Before the ice is in the pools,
  Before the skaters go,
Or any cheek at nightfall
  Is tarnished by the snow,

Before the fields have finished,
  Before the Christmas tree,
Wonder upon wonder
  Will arrive to me!

What we touch the hems of
  On a summer's day;
What is only walking
  Just a bridge away;

That which sings so, speaks so,
  When there's no one here, --
Will the frock I wept in
  Answer me to wear?





XLVI.

DYING.

I heard a fly buzz when I died;
  The stillness round my form
Was like the stillness in the air
  Between the heaves of storm.

The eyes beside had wrung them dry,
  And breaths were gathering sure
For that last onset, when the king
  Be witnessed in his power.

I willed my keepsakes, signed away
  What portion of me I
Could make assignable, -- and then
  There interposed a fly,

With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,
  Between the light and me;
And then the windows failed, and then
  I could not see to see.





XLVII.

Adrift! A little boat adrift!
  And night is coming down!
Will no one guide a little boat
  Unto the nearest town?

So sailors say, on yesterday,
  Just as the dusk was brown,
One little boat gave up its strife,
  And gurgled down and down.

But angels say, on yesterday,
  Just as the dawn was red,
One little boat o'erspent with gales
Retrimmed its masts, redecked its sails
  Exultant, onward sped!





XLVIII.

There's been a death in the opposite house
  As lately as to-day.
I know it by the numb look
  Such houses have alway.

The neighbors rustle in and out,
  The doctor drives away.
A window opens like a pod,
  Abrupt, mechanically;

Somebody flings a mattress out, --
  The children hurry by;
They wonder if It died on that, --
  I used to when a boy.

The minister goes stiffly in
  As if the house were his,
And he owned all the mourners now,
  And little boys besides;

And then the milliner, and the man
  Of the appalling trade,
To take the measure of the house.
  There'll be that dark parade

Of tassels and of coaches soon;
  It's easy as a sign, --
The intuition of the news
  In just a country town.





XLIX.

We never know we go, -- when we are going
  We jest and shut the door;
Fate following behind us bolts it,
  And we accost no more.




L.

THE SOUL'S STORM.

It struck me every day
  The lightning was as new
As if the cloud that instant slit
  And let the fire through.

It burned me in the night,
  It blistered in my dream;
It sickened fresh upon my sight
  With every morning's beam.

I thought that storm was brief, --
  The maddest, quickest by;
But Nature lost the date of this,
  And left it in the sky.





LI.

Water is taught by thirst;
Land, by the oceans passed;
  Transport, by throe;
Peace, by its battles told;
Love, by memorial mould;
  Birds, by the snow.




LII.

THIRST.

We thirst at first, -- 't is Nature's act;
  And later, when we die,
A little water supplicate
  Of fingers going by.

It intimates the finer want,
  Whose adequate supply
Is that great water in the west
  Termed immortality.





LIII.

A clock stopped -- not the mantel's;
  Geneva's farthest skill
Can't put the puppet bowing
  That just now dangled still.

An awe came on the trinket!
  The figures hunched with pain,
Then quivered out of decimals
  Into degreeless noon.

It will not stir for doctors,
  This pendulum of snow;
The shopman importunes it,
  While cool, concernless No

Nods from the gilded pointers,
  Nods from the seconds slim,
Decades of arrogance between
  The dial life and him.





LIV.

CHARLOTTE BRONT'S GRAVE.

All overgrown by cunning moss,
  All interspersed with weed,
The little cage of 'Currer Bell,'
  In quiet Haworth laid.

This bird, observing others,
  When frosts too sharp became,
Retire to other latitudes,
  Quietly did the same,

But differed in returning;
  Since Yorkshire hills are green,
Yet not in all the nests I meet
  Can nightingale be seen.

Gathered from many wanderings,
  Gethsemane can tell
Through what transporting anguish
  She reached the asphodel!

Soft fall the sounds of Eden
  Upon her puzzled ear;
Oh, what an afternoon for heaven,
  When 'Bront' entered there!





LV.

A toad can die of light!
Death is the common right
  Of toads and men, --
Of earl and midge
The privilege.
  Why swagger then?
The gnat's supremacy
Is large as thine.





LVI.

Far from love the Heavenly Father
  Leads the chosen child;
Oftener through realm of briar
  Than the meadow mild,

Oftener by the claw of dragon
  Than the hand of friend,
Guides the little one predestined
  To the native land.





LVII.

SLEEPING.

A long, long sleep, a famous sleep
  That makes no show for dawn
By stretch of limb or stir of lid, --
  An independent one.

Was ever idleness like this?
  Within a hut of stone
To bask the centuries away
  Nor once look up for noon?





LVIII.

RETROSPECT.

'T was just this time last year I died.
  I know I heard the corn,
When I was carried by the farms, --
  It had the tassels on.

I thought how yellow it would look
  When Richard went to mill;
And then I wanted to get out,
  But something held my will.

I thought just how red apples wedged
  The stubble's joints between;
And carts went stooping round the fields
  To take the pumpkins in.

I wondered which would miss me least,
  And when Thanksgiving came,
If father'd multiply the plates
  To make an even sum.

And if my stocking hung too high,
  Would it blur the Christmas glee,
That not a Santa Claus could reach
  The altitude of me?

But this sort grieved myself, and so
  I thought how it would be
When just this time, some perfect year,
  Themselves should come to me.





LIX.

ETERNITY.

On this wondrous sea,
Sailing silently,
  Ho! pilot, ho!
Knowest thou the shore
Where no breakers roar,
  Where the storm is o'er?

In the silent west
Many sails at rest,
  Their anchors fast;
Thither I pilot thee, --
Land, ho! Eternity!
  Ashore at last!
