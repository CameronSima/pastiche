        at the track today,

        one flies
        off.
        then

        still.
        and I am
        reduced to bird
        watching.
        just thought I'd
        let you
        know,
        fucker.
        





        A Challenge To The Dark
        shot in the eye
        shot in the brain
        shot in the ass
        shot like a flower in the dance
        





        A Following
        the phone rang at 1:30 a.m.
        and it was a man from Denver:
        





        A Man


        





        A Radio With Guts
        it was on the 2nd floor on Coronado Street
        I used to get drunk
        and throw the radio through the window
        while it was playing, and, of course,
        it would break the glass in the window
        and the radio would sit there on the roof
        still playing
        and I'd tell my woman,
        &quot;Ah, what a marvelous radio!&quot;
        the next morning I'd take the window
        off the hinges
        and carry it down the street
        to the glass man
        who would put in another pane.
        I kept throwing that radio through the window
        each time I got drunk
        and it would sit there on the roof
        still playing-
        a magic radio
        a radio with guts,
        and each morning I'd take the window
        back to the glass man.
        I don't remember how it ended exactly
        though I do remember
        we finally moved out.
        there was a woman downstairs who worked in
        the garden in her bathing suit,
        she really dug with that trowel
        and she put her behind up in the air
        and I used to sit in the window
        and watch the sun shine all over that thing
        while the music played.
        





        a smile to remember
        we had goldfish and they circled around and around
        in the bowl on the table near the heavy drapes
        covering the picture window and
        my mother, always smiling, wanting us all
        to be happy, told me, "be happy Henry!"
        and she was right: it's better to be happy if you
        can
        but my father continued to beat her and me several times a week while
        raging inside his 6-foot-two frame because he couldn't
        understand what was attacking him from within.
        my mother, poor fish,
        wanting to be happy, beaten two or three times a
        week, telling me to be happy: "Henry, smile!
        why don't you ever smile?"
        and then she would smile, to show me how, and it was the
        saddest smile I ever saw
        one day the goldfish died, all five of them,
        they floated on the water, on their sides, their
        eyes still open,
        and when my father got home he threw them to the cat
        there on the kitchen floor and we watched as my mother
        smiled
        





        Alone With Everybody
        the flesh covers the bone
        and they put a mind
        in there and
        sometimes a soul,
        and the women break
        vases against the walls
        and the men drink too
        much
        and nobody finds the
        one
        but keep
        looking
        crawling in and out
        of beds.
        flesh covers
        the bone and the
        flesh searches
        for more than
        flesh.
        there's no chance
        at all:
        we are all trapped
        by a singular
        fate.
        nobody ever finds
        the one.
        the city dumps fill
        the junkyards fill
        the madhouses fill
        the hospitals fill
        the graveyards fill
        nothing else
        fills.

        An Almost Made Up Poem
        I see you drinking at a fountain with tiny
        blue hands, no, your hands are not tiny
        they are small, and the fountain is in France
        where you wrote me that last letter and
        I answered and never heard from you again.
        you used to write insane poems about
        ANGELS AND GOD, all in upper case, and you
        knew famous artists and most of them
        were your lovers, and I wrote back, it&#146; all right,
        go ahead, enter their lives, I&#146; not jealous
        because we&#146; never met. we got close once in
        New Orleans, one half block, but never met, never
        touched. so you went with the famous and wrote
        about the famous, and, of course, what you found out
        is that the famous are worried about
        their fame &#150;&#150; not the beautiful young girl in bed
        with them, who gives them that, and then awakens
        in the morning to write upper case poems about
        ANGELS AND GOD. we know God is dead, they&#146; told
        us, but listening to you I wasn&#146; sure. maybe
        it was the upper case. you were one of the
        best female poets and I told the publishers,
        editors, &#147; her, print her, she&#146; mad but she&#146;
        magic. there&#146; no lie in her fire.&#148; I loved you
        like a man loves a woman he never touches, only
        writes to, keeps little photographs of. I would have
        loved you more if I had sat in a small room rolling a
        cigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom,
        but that didn&#146; happen. your letters got sadder.
        your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, all
        lovers betray. it didn&#146; help. you said
        you had a crying bench and it was by a bridge and
        the bridge was over a river and you sat on the crying
        bench every night and wept for the lovers who had
        hurt and forgotten you. I wrote back but never
        heard again. a friend wrote me of your suicide
        3 or 4 months after it happened. if I had met you
        I would probably have been unfair to you or you
        to me. it was best like this.
        





        And The Moon And The Stars And The World
        Long walks at night--
        that's what good for the soul:
        peeking into windows
        watching tired housewives
        trying to fight off
        their beer-maddened husbands.
        





        Another Day
        having the low down blues and going
        into a restraunt to eat.
        you sit at a table.
        the waitress smiles at you.
        she's dumpy. her ass is too big.
        she radiates kindess and symphaty.
        live with her 3 months and a man would no real agony.
        o.k., you'll tip her 15 percent.
        you order a turkey sandwich and a
        beer.
        the man at the table across from you
        has watery blue eyes and
        a head like an elephant.
        at a table further down are 3 men
        with very tiny heads
        and long necks
        like ostiches.
        they talk loudly of land development.
        why, you think, did I ever come
        in here when I have the low-down
        blues?
        then the the waitress comes back eith the sandwich
        and she asks you if there will be anything
        else?
        snd you tell her, no no, this will be
        fine.
        then somebody behind you laughs.
        it's a cork laugh filled with sand and
        broken glass.
        you begin eating the sandwhich.
        it's something.
        it's a minor, difficult,
        sensible action
        like composing a popular song
        to make a 14-year old
        weep.
        you order another beer.
        jesus,look at that guy
        his hands hang down almost to his knees and he's
        whistling.
        well, time to get out.
        pivk up the bill.
        tip.
        go to the register.
        pay.
        pick up a toothpick.
        go out the door.
        your car is still there.
        and there are 3 men with heads
        and necks

        like ostriches all getting into one
        car.
        they each have a toothpick and now
        they are talking about women.
        they drive away first
        they drive away fast.
        they're best i guess.
        it's an unberably hot day.
        there's a first-stage smog alert.
        all the birds and plants are dead
        or dying.
        you start the engine.

        Are You Drinking?
        washed-up, on shore, the old yellow notebook
        out again
        I write from the bed
        as I did last
        year.
        will see the doctor,
        Monday.
        &quot;yes, doctor, weak legs, vertigo, head-
        aches and my back
        hurts.&quot;
        &quot;are you drinking?&quot; he will ask.
        &quot;are you getting your
        exercise, your
        vitamins?&quot;
        I think that I am just ill
        with life, the same stale yet
        fluctuating
        factors.
        even at the track
        I watch the horses run by
        and it seems
        meaningless.
        I leave early after buying tickets on the
        remaining races.
        &quot;taking off?&quot; asks the motel
        clerk.
        &quot;yes, it's boring,&quot;
        I tell him.
        &quot;If you think it's boring
        out there,&quot; he tells me, &quot;you oughta be
        back here.&quot;
        so here I am
        propped up against my pillows
        again
        just an old guy
        just an old writer
        with a yellow
        notebook.
        something is
        walking across the
        floor
        toward
        me.
        oh, it's just
        my cat
        this
        time.
        




        As The Poems Go
        as the poems go into the thousands you
        realize that you've created very
        little.
        





        As The Sparrow
        To give life you must take life,
        and as our grief falls flat and hollow
        upon the billion-blooded sea
        I pass upon serious inward-breaking shoals rimmed
        with white-legged, white-bellied rotting creatures
        lengthily dead and rioting against surrounding scenes.
        Dear child, I only did to you what the sparrow
        did to you; I am old when it is fashionable to be
        young; I cry when it is fashionable to laugh.
        I hated you when it would have taken less courage
        to love.
        





        back to the machine gun
        I awaken about noon and go out to get the mail
        in my old torn bathrobe.
        I'm hung over
        hair down in my eyes
        barefoot
        gingerly walking on the small sharp rocks
        in my path
        still afraid of pain behind my four-day beard.
        the young housewife next door shakes a rug
        out of her window and sees me:
        "hello, Hank!"
        god damn! it's almost like being shot in the ass
        with a .22
        "hello," I say
        gathering up my Visa card bill, my Pennysaver coupons,
        a Dept. of Water and Power past-due notice,
        a letter from the mortgage people
        plus a demand from the Weed Abatement Department
        giving me 30 days to clean up my act.
        I mince back again over the small sharp rocks
        thinking, maybe I'd better write something tonight,
        they all seem
        to be closing in.
        there's only one way to handle those motherfuckers.
        the night harness races will have to wait.

        Big Night On The Town
        drunk on the dark streets of some city,
        it's night, you're lost, where's your
        room?
        you enter a bar to find yourself,
        order scotch and water.
        damned bar's sloppy wet, it soaks
        part of one of your shirt
        sleeves.
        It's a clip joint-the scotch is weak.
        you order a bottle of beer.
        Madame Death walks up to you
        wearing a dress.
        she sits down, you buy her a
        beer, she stinks of swamps, presses
        a leg against you.
        the bar tender sneers.
        you've got him worried, he doesn't
        know if you're a cop, a killer, a
        madman or an
        Idiot.
        you ask for a vodka.
        you pour the vodka into the top of
        the beer bottle.
        It's one a.m. In a dead cow world.
        you ask her how much for head,
        drink everything down, it tastes
        like machine oil.
        you leave Madame Death there,
        you leave the sneering bartender
        there.
        you have remembered where
        your room is.
        the room with the full bottle of
        wine on the dresser.
        the room with the dance of the
        roaches.
        Perfection in the Star Turd
        where love died
        laughing.
        





        Bluebird
        there's a bluebird in my heart that
        wants to get out
        but I'm too tough for him,
        I say, stay in there, I'm not going
        to let anybody see
        you.
        





        Carson McCullers
        she died of alcoholism
        wrapped in a blanket
        on a deck chair
        on an ocean
        steamer.
        all her books of
        terrified loneliness
        all her books about
        the cruelty
        of loveless love
        were all that was left
        of her
        as the strolling vacationer
        discovered her body
        notified the captain
        and she was quickly dispatched
        to somewhere else
        on the ship
        as everything
        continued just
        as
        she had written it
        





        Cause And Effect
        the best often die by their own hand
        just to get away,
        and those left behind
        can never quite understand
        why anybody
        would ever want to
        get away
        from
        them
        





        close to greatness
        at one stage in my life
        I met a man who claimed to have
        visited Pound at St. Elizabeths.
        then I met a woman who not only
        claimed to have visited
        E.P.
        but also to have made love
        to him--she even showed
        me
        certain sections in the
        Cantos
        where Ezra was supposed to have
        mentioned
        her.
        so there was this man and
        this woman
        and the woman told me
        that Pound had never
        mentioned a visit from this
        man
        and the man claimed that the
        lady had had nothing to do
        with the
        master
        that she was a
        charlatan
        and since I wasn't a
        Poundian scholar
        I didn't know who to
        believe
        but one thing I do
        know: when a man is
        living
        many claim relationships
        that are hardly
        so
        and after he dies, well,
        then it's everybody's
        party.
        my guess is that Pound
        knew neither the lady or the
        gentleman
        or if he knew
        one
        or if he knew
        both


        it was a shameful waste of
        madhouse
        time.
        





        Confession
        waiting for death
        like a cat
        that will jump on the
        bed
        I am so very sorry for
        my wife
        she will see this
        stiff
        white
        body
        shake it once, then
        maybe
        again
        "Hank!"
        Hank won't
        answer.
        it's not my death that
        worries me, it's my wife
        left with this
        pile of
        nothing.
        I want to
        let her know
        though
        that all the nights
        sleeping
        beside her
        even the useless
        arguments
        were things
        ever splendid
        and the hard
        words
        I ever feared to
        say
        can now be
        said:
        I love
        you.
        



        Consummation Of Grief
        I even hear the mountains
        the way they laugh
        up and down their blue sides
        and down in the water
        the fish cry
        and the water
        is their tears.
        I listen to the water
        on nights I drink away
        and the sadness becomes so great
        I hear it in my clock
        it becomes knobs upon my dresser
        it becomes paper on the floor
        it becomes a shoehorn
        a laundry ticket
        it becomes
        cigarette smoke
        climbing a chapel of dark vines. . .
        it matters little
        very little love is not so bad
        or very little life
        what counts
        is waiting on walls
        I was born for this
        I was born to hustle roses down the avenues of the dead.

        good weather
        is like
        good women-
        it doesn't always happen
        and when it does
        it doesn't
        always last.
        man is
        more stable:
        if he's bad
        there's more chance
        he'll stay that way,
        or if he's good
        he might hang
        on,
        but a woman
        is changed
        by
        children
        age
        diet
        conversation
        sex
        the moon
        the absence or
        presence of sun
        or good times.
        a woman must be nursed
        into subsistence
        by love
        where a man can become
        stronger
        by being hated.
        





        Curtain
        the final curtain on one of the longest running
        musicals ever, some people claim to have
        seen it over one hundred times.
        I saw it on the tv news, that final curtain:
        flowers, cheers, tears, a thunderous
        accolade.
        I have not seen this particular musical
        but I know if I had that I wouldn't have
        been able to bear it, it would have
        sickened me.
        trust me on this, the world and its
        peoples and its artful entertainment has
        done very little for me, only to me.
        still, let them enjoy one another, it will
        keep them from my door
        and for this, my own thunderous
        accolade.
        





        Cut While Shaving
        It's never quite right, he said, the way people look,
        the way the music sounds, the way the words are
        written.
        It's never quite right, he said, all the things we are
        taught, all the loves we chase, all the deaths we
        die, all the lives we live,
        they are never quite right,
        they are hardly close to right,
        these lives we live
        one after the other,
        piled there as history,
        the waste of the species,
        the crushing of the light and the way,
        it's not quite right,
        it's hardly right at all
        he said.
        don't I know it? I
        answered.
        I walked away from the mirror.
        it was morning, it was afternoon, it was
        night
        nothing changed
        it was locked in place.
        something flashed, something broke, something
        remained.
        I walked down the stairway and
        into it.

        Death Wants More Death
        death wants more death, and its webs are full:
        I remember my father's garage, how child-like
        I would brush the corpses of flies
        from the windows they thought were escape-
        their sticky, ugly, vibrant bodies
        shouting like dumb crazy dogs against the glass
        only to spin and flit
        in that second larger than hell or heaven
        onto the edge of the ledge,
        and then the spider from his dank hole
        nervous and exposed
        the puff of body swelling
        hanging there
        not really quite knowing,
        and then knowing-
        something sending it down its string,
        the wet web,
        toward the weak shield of buzzing,
        the pulsing;
        a last desperate moving hair-leg
        there against the glass
        there alive in the sun,
        spun in white;
        and almost like love:
        the closing over,
        the first hushed spider-sucking:
        filling its sack
        upon this thing that lived;
        crouching there upon its back
        drawing its certain blood
        as the world goes by outside
        and my temples scream
        and I hurl the broom against them:
        the spider dull with spider-anger
        still thinking of its prey
        and waving an amazed broken leg;
        the fly very still,
        a dirty speck stranded to straw;
        I shake the killer loose
        and he walks lame and peeved
        towards some dark corner
        but I intercept his dawdling
        his crawling like some broken hero,
        and the straws smash his legs
        now waving
        above his head
        and looking
        looking for the enemy
        and somewhat valiant,
        dying without apparent pain
        simply crawling backward
        piece by piece

        leaving nothing there
        until at last the red gut sack
        splashes
        its secrets,
        and I run child-like
        with God's anger a step behind,
        back to simple sunlight,
        wondering
        as the world goes by
        with curled smile
        if anyone else
        saw or sensed my crime
        





        Decline
        naked along the side of the house,
        8 a.m., spreading sesame seed oil
        over my body, Jesus, have I come
        to this?
        I once battled in dark alleys for a
        laugh.
        now I'm not laughing.
        I splash myself with oil and wonder,
        how many years do you want?
        how many days?
        my blood is soiled and a dark
        angel sits in my brain.
        things are made of something and
        go to nothing.
        I understand the fall of cities, of
        nations.
        a small plane passes overhead.
        I look upward as if it made sense to
        look upward.
        it's true, the sky has rotted:
        it won't be long for any of
        us.
        





        Eat Your Heart Out
        I've come by, she says, to tell you
        that this is it. I'm not kidding, it's
        over. this is it.
        I sit on the couch watching her arrange
        her long red hair before my bedroom
        mirror.
        she pulls her hair up and
        piles it on top of her head-
        she lets her eyes look at
        my eyes-
        then she drops her hair and
        lets it fall down in front of her face.
        we go to bed and I hold her
        speechlessly from the back
        my arm around her neck
        I touch her wrists and hands
        feel up to
        her elbows
        no further.
        she gets up.
        this is it, she says,
        this will do. well,
        I'm going.
        I get up and walk her
        to the door
        just as she leaves
        she says,
        I want you to buy me
        some high-heeled shoes
        with tall thin spikes,
        black high-heeled shoes.
        no, I want them
        red.
        I watch her walk down the cement walk
        under the trees
        she walks all right and
        as the pointsettas drip in the sun
        I close the door.
        

        Eulogy To A Hell Of A Dame
        some dogs who sleep At night
        must dream of bones
        and I remember your bones
        in flesh
        and best
        in that dark green dress
        and those high-heeled bright
        black shoes,
        you always cursed when you drank,
        your hair coming down you
        wanted to explode out of
        what was holding you:
        rotten memories of a
        rotten
        past, and
        you finally got
        out
        by dying,
        leaving me with the
        rotten
        present;
        you've been dead
        28 years
        yet I remember you
        better than any of
        the rest;
        you were the only one
        who understood
        the futility of the
        arrangement of
        life;
        all the others were only
        displeased with
        trivial segments,
        carped
        nonsensically about
        nonsense;
        Jane, you were
        killed by
        knowing too much.
        here's a drink
        to your bones
        that
        this dog
        still
        dreams about.
        





        Finish
        We are like roses that have never bothered to
        bloom when we should have bloomed and
        it is as if
        the sun has become disgusted with
        waiting
        





        finished?
        the critics now have me
        drinking champagne and
        driving a BMW
        and also married to a
        socialite from
        Philadelphia's Main Line
        which of course is going to prevent me
        from writing my earthy
        and grubby stuff.
        and they might be
        right,
        I could be getting to be
        more like them,
        and that's as close to
        death as you can
        get.
        we'll see.
        but don't bury me yet.
        don't worry if I drink with
        Sean Penn.
        just measure the poems
        as they come off the
        keyboard.
        listen only to them.
        after this long fight
        I have no intention of
        quitting short.
        or late.
        or satisfied.
        





        Flophouse
        you haven't lived
        until you've been in a
        flophouse
        with nothing but one
        light bulb
        and 56 men
        squeezed together
        on cots
        with everybody
        snoring
        at once
        and some of those
        snores
        so
        deep and
        gross and
        unbelievable-
        dark
        snotty
        gross
        subhuman
        wheezings
        from hell
        itself.
        your mind
        almost breaks
        under those
        death-like
        sounds
        and the
        intermingling
        odors:
        hard
        unwashed socks
        pissed and
        shitted
        underwear
        and over it all
        slowly circulating
        air
        much like that
        emanating from
        uncovered
        garbage
        cans.
        and those
        bodies
        in the dark
        fat and
        thin
        and
        bent

        some
        legless
        armless
        some
        mindless
        and worst of
        all:
        the total
        absence of
        hope
        it shrouds
        them
        covers them
        totally.
        it's not
        bearable.
        you get
        up
        go out
        walk the
        streets
        up and
        down
        sidewalks
        past buildings
        around the
        corner
        and back
        up
        the samestreet
        thinking
        those men
        were all
        children
        once
        what has happened
        to
        them?
        and what has
        happened
        to
        me?
        it's dark
        and cold
        out
        here.
        





        For Jane
        225 days under grass
        and you know more than I.
        they have long taken your blood,
        you are a dry stick in a basket.
        is this how it works?
        in this room
        the hours of love
        still make shadows.
        when you left
        you took almost
        everything.
        I kneel in the nights
        before tigers
        that will not let me be.
        what you were
        will not happen again.
        the tigers have found me
        and I do not care.
        





        For Jane: With All The Love I Had, Which Was Not Enough
        I pick up the skirt,
        I pick up the sparkling beads
        in black,
        this thing that moved once
        around flesh,
        and I call God a liar,
        I say anything that moved
        like that
        or knew
        my name
        could never die
        in the common verity of dying,
        and I pick
        up her lovely
        dress,
        all her loveliness gone,
        and I speak to all the gods,
        Jewish gods, Christ-gods,
        chips of blinking things,
        idols, pills, bread,
        fathoms, risks,
        knowledgeable surrender,
        rats in the gravy of 2 gone quite mad
        without a chance,
        hummingbird knowledge, hummingbird chance,
        I lean upon this,
        I lean on all of this
        and I know:
        her dress upon my arm:
        but
        they will not
        give her back to me.

        Freedom
        he drank wine all night of the
        28th, and he kept thinking of her:
        the way she walked and talked and loved
        the way she told him things that seemed true
        but were not, and he knew the color of each
        of her dresses
        and her shoes-he knew the stock and curve of
        each heel
        as well as the leg shaped by it.
        and she was out again and when he came home,and
        she'd come back with that special stink again,
        and she did
        she came in at 3 a.m in the morning
        filthy like a dung eating swine
        and
        he took out a butchers knife
        and she screamed
        backing into the rooming house wall
        still pretty somehow
        in spite of love's reek
        and he finished the glass of wine.
        that yellow dress
        his favorite
        and she screamed again.
        and he took up the knife
        and unhooked his belt
        and tore away the cloth before her
        and cut off his balls.
        and carried them in his hands
        like apricots
        and flushed them down the
        toilet bowl
        and she kept screaming
        as the room became red
        GOD O GOD!
        WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
        and he sat there holding 3 towels
        between his legs
        no caring now whether she left or
        stayed
        wore yellow or green or
        anything at all.
        and one hand holding and one hand
        lifting he poured
        another wine

        





        Friends Within The Darkness
        I can remember starving in a
        small room in a strange city
        shades pulled down, listening to
        classical music
        I was young I was so young it hurt like a knife
        inside
        because there was no alternative except to hide as long
        as possible--
        not in self-pity but with dismay at my limited chance:
        trying to connect.
        the old composers -- Mozart, Bach, Beethoven,
        Brahms were the only ones who spoke to me and
        they were dead.
        finally, starved and beaten, I had to go into
        the streets to be interviewed for low-paying and
        monotonous
        jobs
        by strange men behind desks
        men without eyes men without faces
        who would take away my hours
        break them
        piss on them.
        now I work for the editors the readers the
        critics
        but still hang around and drink with
        Mozart, Bach, Brahms and the
        Bee
        some buddies
        some men
        sometimes all we need to be able to continue alone
        are the dead
        rattling the walls
        that close us in.

        gamblers all
        sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think,
        <i>I'm not going to make it</i>, but you laugh inside
        remembering all the times you've felt that way, and
        you walk to the bathroom, do your toilet, see that face
        in the mirror, oh my oh my oh my, but you comb your hair anyway,
        get into your street clothes, feed the cats, fetch the
        newspaper of horror, place it on the coffee table, kiss your
        wife goodbye, and then you are backing the car out into life itself,
        like millions of others you enter the arena once more.
        you are on the freeway threading through traffic now,
        moving both towards something and towards nothing at all as you punch
        the radio on and get Mozart, which is something, and you will somehow
        get through the slow days and the busy days and the dull
        days and the hateful days and the rare days, all both so delightful
        and so disappointing because
        we are all so alike and so different.
        you find the turn-off, drive through the most dangerous
        part of town, feel momentarily wonderful as Mozart works
        his way into your brain and slides down along your bones and
        out through your shoes.
        it's been a tough fight worth fighting
        as we all drive along
        betting on another day.
        





        Girl In A Miniskirt Reading The Bible Outside My Window
        Sunday, I am eating a
        grapefruit, church is over at the Russian
        Orthadox to the
        west.
        she is dark
        of Eastern descent,
        large brown eyes look up from the Bible
        then down. a small red and black
        Bible, and as she reads
        her legs keep moving, moving,
        she is doing a slow rythmic dance
        reading the Bible. . .
        long gold earrings;
        2 gold bracelets on each arm,
        and it's a mini-suit, I suppose,
        the cloth hugs her body,
        the lightest of tans is that cloth,
        she twists this way and that,
        long yellow legs warm in the sun. . .
        there is no escaping her being
        there is no desire to. . .
        my radio is playing symphonic music
        that she cannot hear
        but her movements coincide exactly
        to the rythms of the
        symphony. . .
        she is dark, she is dark
        she is reading about God.
        I am God.
        





        having the flu and with nothing else to do
        I read a book about John Dos Passos and according to
        the book once radical-communist
        John ended up in the Hollywood Hills living off investments
        and reading the
        <i>Wall Street Journal </i>
        this seems to happen all too often.
        what hardly ever happens is
        a man going from being a young conservative to becoming an
        old wild-ass radical
        however:
        young conservatives always seem to become old
        conservatives.
        it's a kind of lifelong mental vapor-lock.
        but when a young radical ends up an
        old radical
        the critics
        and the conservatives
        treat him as if he escaped from a mental
        institution.
        such is our politics and you can have it
        all.
        keep it.
        sail it up your
        ass.
        





        hello, how are you?
        this fear of being what they are:
        dead.
        at least they are not out on the street, they
        are careful to stay indoors, those
        pasty mad who sit alone before their tv sets,
        their lives full of canned, mutilated laughter.
        their ideal neighborhood
        of parked cars
        of little green lawns
        of little homes
        the little doors that open and close
        as their relatives visit
        throughout the holidays
        the doors closing
        behind the dying who die so slowly
        behind the dead who are still alive
        in your quiet average neighborhood
        of winding streets
        of agony
        of confusion
        of horror
        of fear
        of ignorance.
        a dog standing behind a fence.
        a man silent at the window.
        





        Here I Am ...
        drunk again at 3 a.m. at the end of my 2nd bottle
        of wine, I have typed from a dozen to 15 pages of
        poesy
        an old man
        maddened for the flesh of young girls in this
        dwindling twilight
        liver gone
        kidneys going
        pancrea pooped
        top-floor blood pressure
        





        His Wife, The Painter
        There are sketches on the walls of men and women and ducks,
        and outside a large green bus swerves through traffic like
        insanity sprung from a waving line; Turgenev, Turgenev,
        says the radio, and Jane Austin, Jane Austin, too.
        &quot;I am going to do her portrait on the 28th, while you are
        at work.&quot;
        





        Hooray Say The Roses
        hooray say the roses, today is blamesday
        and we are red as blood.
        hooray say the roses, today is Wednesday
        and we bloom wher soldiers fell
        and lovers too,
        and the snake at the word.
        hooray say the roses, darkness comes
        all at once, like lights gone out,
        the sun leaves dark continents
        and rows of stone.
        hooray say the roses, cannons and spires,
        birds, bees, bombers, today is Friday
        the hand holding a medal out the window,
        a moth going by, half a mile an hour,
        hooray hooray
        hooray say the roses
        we have empires on our stems,
        the sun moves the mouth:
        hooray hooray hooray
        and that is why you like us.

        Hot
        she was hot, she was so hot
        I didn't want anybody else to have her,
        and if I didn't get home on time
        she'd be gone, and I couldn't bear that-
        I'd go mad. . .
        it was foolish I know, childish,
        but I was caught in it, I was caught.
        I delivered all the mail
        and then Henderson put me on the night pickup run
        in an old army truck,
        the damn thing began to heat halfway through the run
        and the night went on
        me thinking about my hot Miriam
        and jumping in and out of the truck
        filling mailsacks
        the engine continuing to heat up
        the temperature needle was at the top
        HOT HOT
        like Miriam.
        leaped in and out
        3 more pickups and into the station
        I'd be, my car
        waiting to get me to Miriam who sat on my blue couch
        with scotch on the rocks
        crossing her legs and swinging her ankles
        like she did,
        2 more stops. . .
        the truck stalled at a traffic light, it was hell
        kicking it over
        again. . .
        I had to be home by 8,8 was the deadline for Miriam.
        I made the last pickup and the truck stalled at a signal
        1/2 block from the station. . .
        it wouldn't start, it couldn't start. . .
        I locked the doors, pulled the key and ran down to the
        station. . .
        I threw the keys down. . .signed out. . .
        your goddamned truck is stalled at the signal,
        I shouted,
        Pico and Western. . .
        . . .I ran down the hall,put the key into the door,
        opened it. . .her drinking glass was there, and a note:
        





        How Is Your Heart?
        during my worst times
        on the park benches
        in the jails
        or living with
        whores
        I always had this certain
        contentment-
        I wouldn't call it
        happiness-
        it was more of an inner
        balance
        that settled for
        whatever was occuring
        and it helped in the
        factories
        and when relationships
        went wrong
        with the
        girls.
        





        I like your books
        In the betting line the other
        day
        man behind me asked,
        "are you Henry
        Chinaski?"
        "uh huh," I answered.
        "I like your books," he went
        on.
        "thanks," I answered.
        "who do you like in this
        race?" he asked.
        "uh uh," I answered.
        "I like the 4 horse," he
        told me.
        I made my bet and went back
        to my seat....
        the next race I am standing in
        line and here is this same man
        standing behind me
        again.
        there are at least 50 lines at
        the windows but
        he has to find mine
        again.
        "I think this race favors the
        closers," he said to the back of
        my neck. "the track looks
        heavy."
        "listen," I said, not looking
        around, "it's the kiss of death to
        talk about horses at the
        track..."
        "what kind of rule is that?"
        he asked. "God doesn't make
        rules..."
        I turned around and looked at him:
        "maybe not, but I
        do."
        after the next race

        I got in line, glanced behind
        me:
        he was not there:
        lost another reader.
        I lose 2 or 3 each
        week.
        fine.
        let 'em go back to
        Kafka.
        





        I Made A Mistake
        I reached up into the top of the closet
        and took out a pair of blue panties
        and showed them to her and
        asked &quot;are these yours?&quot;
        





        I Met A Genius
        I met a genius on the train
        today
        about 6 years old,
        he sat beside me
        and as the train
        ran down along the coast
        we came to the ocean
        and then he looked at me
        and said,
        it's not pretty.
        





        I'm In Love
        she's young, she said,
        but look at me,
        I have pretty ankles,
        and look at my wrists, I have pretty
        wrists
        o my god,
        I thought it was all working,
        and now it's her again,
        every time she phones you go crazy,
        you told me it was over
        you told me it was finished,
        listen, I've lived long enough to become a
        good woman,
        why do you need a bad woman?
        you need to be tortured, don't you?
        you think life is rotten if somebody treats you
        rotten it all fits,
        doesn't it?
        tell me, is that it? do you want to be treated like a
        piece of shit?
        and my son, my son was going to meet you.
        I told my son
        and I dropped all my lovers.
        I stood up in a cafe and screamed
        I'M IN LOVE,
        and now you've made a fool of me. . .
        I'm sorry, I said, I'm really sorry.
        hold me, she said, will you please hold me?
        I've never been in one of these things before, I said,
        these triangles. . .
        she got up and lit a cigarette, she was trembling all
        over.she paced up and down,wild and crazy.she had
        a small body.her arms were thin,very thin and when
        she screamed and started beating me I held her
        wrists and then I got it through the eyes:hatred,
        centuries deep and true.I was wrong and graceless and
        sick.all the things I had learned had been wasted.
        there was no creature living as foul as I
        and all my poems were
        false.
        





        it was just a little while ago
        almost dawn
        blackbirds on the telephone wire
        waiting
        as I eat yesterday's
        forgotten sandwich
        at 6 a.m.
        an a quiet Sunday morning.
        one shoe in the corner
        standing upright
        the other laying on it's
        side.
        yes, some lives were made to be
        wasted.
        





        It's Ours
        there is always that space there
        just before they get to us
        that space
        that fine relaxer
        the breather
        while say
        flopping on a bed
        thinking of nothing
        or say
        pouring a glass of water from the
        spigot
        while entranced by
        nothing
        that
        gentle pure
        space
        it's worth
        centuries of
        existence
        say
        just to scratch your neck
        while looking out the window at
        a bare branch
        that space
        there
        before they get to us
        ensures
        that
        when they do
        they won't
        get it all
        ever.

        Layover
        Making love in the sun, in the morning sun
        in a hotel room
        above the alley
        where poor men poke for bottles;
        making love in the sun
        making love by a carpet redder than our blood,
        making love while the boys sell headlines
        and Cadillacs,
        making love by a photograph of Paris
        and an open pack of Chesterfields,
        making love while other men- poor folks-
        work.
        That moment- to this. . .
        may be years in the way they measure,
        but it's only one sentence back in my mind-
        there are so many days
        when living stops and pulls up and sits
        and waits like a train on the rails.
        I pass the hotel at 8
        and at 5; there are cats in the alleys
        and bottles and bums,
        and I look up at the window and think,
        I no longer know where you are,
        and I walk on and wonder where
        the living goes
        when it stops.
        





        Let It Enfold You
        either peace or happiness,
        let it enfold you
        when I was a young man
        I felt these things were
        dumb, unsophisticated.
        I had bad blood, a twisted
        mind, a precarious
        upbringing.
        I was hard as granite, I
        leered at the
        sun.
        I trusted no man and
        especially no
        woman.
        I was living a hell in
        small rooms, I broke
        things, smashed things,
        walked through glass,
        cursed.
        I challenged everything,
        was continually being
        evicted, jailed,in and
        out of fights, in and out
        of my mind.
        women were something
        to screw and rail
        at, I had no male
        freinds,
        I changed jobs and
        cities, I hated holidays,
        babies, history,
        newspapers, museums,
        grandmothers,
        marriage, movies,
        spiders, garbagemen,
        english accents,spain,
        france,italy,walnuts and
        the color
        orange.
        algebra angred me,
        opera sickened me,
        charlie chaplin was a
        fake
        and flowers were for
        pansies.
        peace an happiness to me
        were signs of

        inferiority,
        tenants of the weak
        an
        addled
        mind.
        but as I went on with
        my alley fights,
        my suicidal years,
        my passage through
        any number of
        women-it gradually
        began to occur to
        me
        that I wasn't different
        from the
        others, I was the same,
        they were all fulsome
        with hatred,
        glossed over with petty
        greivances,
        the men I fought in
        alleys had hearts of stone.
        everybody was nudging,
        inching, cheating for
        some insignificant
        advantage,
        the lie was the
        weapon and the
        plot was
        empty,
        darkness was the
        dictator.
        cautiously, I allowed
        myself to feel good
        at times.
        I found moments of
        peace in cheap
        rooms
        just staring at the
        knobs of some
        dresser
        or listening to the
        rain in the
        dark.
        the less I needed
        the better I
        felt.


        maybe the other life had worn me
        down.
        I no longer found
        glamour
        in topping somebody
        in conversation.
        or in mounting the
        body of some poor
        drunken female
        whose life had
        slipped away into
        sorrow.
        I could never accept
        life as it was,
        i could never gobble
        down all its
        poisons
        but there were parts,
        tenous magic parts
        open for the
        asking.
        I re formulated
        I don't know when,
        date, time, all
        that
        but the change
        occured.
        something in me
        relaxed, smoothed
        out.
        i no longer had to
        prove that I was a
        man,
        I did'nt have to prove
        anything.
        I began to see things:
        coffee cups lined up
        behind a counter in a
        cafe.
        or a dog walking along
        a sidewalk.
        or the way the mouse
        on my dresser top
        stopped there
        with its body,
        its ears,
        its nose,
        it was fixed,

        a bit of life
        caught within itself
        and its eyes looked
        at me
        and they were
        beautiful.
        then- it was
        gone.
        I began to feel good,
        I began to feel good
        in the worst situations
        and there were plenty
        of those.
        like say, the boss
        behind his desk,
        he is going to have
        to fire me.
        I've missed too many
        days.
        he is dressed in a
        suit, necktie, glasses,
        he says, "I am going
        to have to let you go"
        "it's all right" I tell
        him.
        He must do what he
        must do, he has a
        wife, a house, children.
        expenses, most probably
        a girlfreind.
        I am sorry for him
        he is caught.
        I walk onto the blazing
        sunshine.
        the whole day is
        mine
        temporailiy,
        anyhow.
        (the whole world is at the
        throat of the world,
        everybody feels angry,
        short-changed, cheated,
        everybody is despondent,
        dissillusioned)


        I welcomed shots of
        peace, tattered shards of
        happiness.
        I embraced that stuff
        like the hottest number,
        like high heels, breasts,
        singing,the
        works.
        (dont get me wrong,
        there is such a thing as cockeyed optimism
        that overlooks all
        basic problems just for
        the sake of
        itself-
        this is a shield and a
        sickness.)
        The knife got near my
        throat again,
        I almost turned on the
        gas
        again
        but when the good
        moments arrived
        again
        I did'nt fight them off
        like an alley
        adversary.
        I let them take me,
        i luxuriated in them,
        I bade them welcome
        home.
        I even looked into
        the mirror
        once having thought
        myself to be
        ugly,
        I now liked what
        I saw,almost
        handsome, yes,
        a bit ripped and
        ragged,
        scares, lumps,
        odd turns,
        but all in all,
        not too bad,
        almost handsome,
        better at least than
        some of those movie
        star faces

        like the cheeks of
        a baby's
        butt.
        and finally I discovered
        real feelings of
        others,
        unheralded,
        like lately,
        like this morning,
        as I was leaving,
        for the track,
        i saw my wife in bed,
        just the
        shape of
        her head there
        (not forgetting
        centuries of the living
        and the dead and
        the dying,
        the pyramids,
        Mozart dead
        but his music still
        there in the
        room, weeds growing,
        the earth turning,
        the toteboard waiting for
        me)
        I saw the shape of my
        wife's head,
        she so still,
        I ached for her life,
        just being there
        under the
        covers.
        I kissed her in the,
        forehead,
        got down the stairway,
        got outside,
        got into my marvelous
        car,
        fixed the seatbelt,
        backed out the
        drive.
        feeling warm to
        the fingertips,
        down to my
        foot on the gas
        pedal,
        I entered the world
        once

        more,
        drove down the
        hill
        past the houses
        full and empty
        of
        people,
        I saw the mailman,
        honked,
        he waved
        back
        at me.

        Like A Flower In The Rain
        I cut the middle fingernail of the middle
        finger
        right hand
        real short
        and I began rubbing along her cunt
        as she sat upright in bed
        spreading lotion over her arms
        face
        and breasts
        after bathing.
        then she lit a cigarette:
        &quot;don't let this put you off,&quot;
        an smoked and continued to rub
        the lotion on.
        I continued to rub the cunt.
        &quot;You want an apple?&quot; I asked.
        &quot;sure, she said, &quot;you got one?&quot;
        but I got to her-
        she began to twist
        then she rolled on her side,
        she was getting wet and open
        like a flower in the rain.
        then she rolled on her stomach
        and her most beautiful ass
        looked up at me
        and I reached under and got the
        cunt again.
        she reached around and got my
        cock, she rolled and twisted,
        I mounted
        my face falling into the mass
        of red hair that overflowed
        from her head
        and my flattened cock entered
        into the miracle.
        later we joked about the lotion
        and the cigarette and the apple.
        then I went out and got some chicken
        and shrimp and french fries and buns
        and mashed potatoes and gravy and
        cole slaw,and we ate.she told me
        how good she felt and I told her
        how good I felt and we
        ate the chicken and the shrimp and the
        french fries and the buns and the
        mashed potatoes and the gravy and
        the cole slaw too.
        




        Love & Fame & Death
        it sits outside my window now
        like and old woman going to market;
        it sits and watches me,
        it sweats nervously
        through wire and fog and dog-bark
        until suddenly
        I slam the screen with a newspaper
        like slapping at a fly
        and you could hear the scream
        over this plain city,
        and then it left.
        the way to end a poem
        like this
        is to become suddenly
        quiet.

        Luck
        once
        we were young
        at this
        machine. . .
        





        magical mystery tour
        I am in this low-slung sports car
        painted a deep, rich yellow
        driving under an Italian sun.
        I have a British accent.
        I'm wearing dark shades
        an expensive silk shirt.
        there's no dirt under my
        fingernails.
        the radio plays Vivaldi
        and there are two women with
        me
        one with raven hair
        the other a blonde.
        they have small breasts and
        beautiful legs
        and they laugh at everything I
        say.
        as we drive up a steep road
        the blonde squeezes my leg
        and nestles closer
        while raven hair
        leans across and nibbles my
        ear.
        we stop for lunch at a quaint
        rustic inn.
        there is more laughter
        before lunch
        during lunch and after
        lunch.
        after lunch we will have a
        flat tire on the other side of
        the mountain
        and the blonde will change the
        tire
        while
        raven hair
        photographs me
        lighting my pipe
        leaning against a tree
        the perfect background
        perfectly at peace
        with
        sunlight
        flowers
        clouds
        birds
        everywhere.
        

        Mama
        here I am   in the ground
                             andopen
                                   my mouth

                   I can't even say
                             mama,
        the dogs run by and stop and piss
                                 and
        on my stone; I get it all
        except the sun
        and my suit is looking
        and yesterday                     bad
                               the last of my left
        very little left, all harp-like         arm  gone
        without music.
        at least a drunk
        in bed with a cigarette
        might cause 5 fire          engines and
                                    33 men.
        I can't  do    any   thing.
        but p.s. -- Hector Richmond in the next
        tomb thinks only of Mozart and candy
        caterpillars.
                 he is  very bad   company.

        Marina
        majestic, majic
        infinite
        my little girl is
        sun
        on the carpet-
        out the door
        picking a flower, ha!
        an old man,
        battle-wrecked,
        emerges from his
        chair
        and she looks at me
        but only sees
        love,
        ha!, and I become
        quick with the world
        and love right back
        just like I was meant
        to do.
        





        Melancholia
        the history of melancholia
        includes all of us.
        





        Metamorphosis
        a girlfriend came in
        built me a bed
        scrubbed and waxed the kitchen floor
        scrubbed the walls
        vacuumed
        cleaned the toilet
        the bathtub
        scrubbed the bathroom floor
        and cut my toenails and
        my hair.
        then
        all on the same day
        the plumber came and fixed the kitchen faucet
        and the toilet
        and the gas man fixed the heater
        and the phone man fixed the phone.
        noe I sit in all this perfection.
        it is quiet.
        I have broken off with all 3 of my girlfriends.
        I felt better when everything was in
        disorder.
        it will take me some months to get back to normal:
        I can't even find a roach to commune with.
        I have lost my rythm.
        I can't sleep.
        I can't eat.
        I have been robbed of
        my filth.
        





        my computer
        "what?" they say, "you got a
        <i>computer</i>?"
        it's like I have sold out to
        the enemy.
        I had no idea so many
        people were prejudiced
        against
        computers.
        even two editors have
        written me letters about
        the computer.
        one disparaged the
        computer in a mild and
        superior way.
        the other seemed
        genuinely
        pissed.
        I am aware that a
        computer can't create
        a poem.
        but neither can a
        typewriter.
        yet, still, once or
        twice a week
        I hear:
        "what?
        you have a
        <i>computer</i>?
        <i>you</i>?"
        yes, I do
        and I sit up here
        almost every
        night,
        sometimes with
        beer or
        wine,
        sometimes
        without
        and I work the
        computer.
        the damn thing
        even corrects
        my spelling.
        and the poems

        come flying
        out,
        better than
        ever.
        I have no
        idea what causes
        all this
        computer
        prejudice.
        me?
        I want to go
        the next step
        beyond the
        computer.
        I'm sure it's
        there.
        and when I get
        it,
        they'll say,
        "hey, you hear,
        Chinaski got a
        <i>space-biter</i>!"
        "what?"
        "yes, it's true!"
        "I can't believe
        it!"
        and I'll also have
        some beer or
        some wine
        or maybe nothing
        at all
        and I'll be
        85 years old
        driving it home
        to
        you and me
        and to the little girl
        who lost her
        sheep.
        or her
        computer.
        



        my father
        was a truly amazing man
        he pretended to be
        rich
        even though we lived on beans and mush and weenies
        when we sat down to eat, he said,
        "not everybody can eat like this."
        and because he wanted to be rich or because he actually
        thought he was rich
        he always voted Republican
        and he voted for Hoover against Roosevelt
        and he lost
        and then he voted for Alf Landon against Roosevelt
        and he lost again
        saying, "I don't know what this world is coming to,
        now we've got that god damned Red in there again
        and the Russians will be in our backyard next!"
        I think it was my father who made me decide to
        become a bum.
        I decided that if a man like that wants to be rich
        then I want to be poor.
        and I became a bum.
        I lived on nickles and dimes and in cheap rooms and
        on park benches.
        I thought maybe the bums knew something.
        but I found out that most of the bums wanted to be
        rich too.
        they had just failed at that.
        so caught between my father and the bums
        I had no place to go
        and I went there fast and slow.
        never voted Republican
        never voted.
        buried him
        like an oddity of the earth
        like a hundred thousand oddities
        like millions of other oddities,
        wasted.
        





        My First Affair With That Older Woman
        when I look back now
        at the abuse I took from
        her
        I feel shame that I was so
        innocent,
        but I must say
        she did match me drink for
        drink,
        and I realized that her life
        her feelings for things
        had been ruined
        along the way
        and that I was no mare than a
        temporary
        companion;
        she was ten years older
        and mortally hurt by the past
        and the present;
        she treated me badly:
        desertion, other
        men;
        she brought me immense
        pain,
        continually;
        she lied, stole;
        there was desertion,


        other men,
        yet we had our moments; and
        our little soap opera ended
        with her in a coma
        in the hospital,
        and I sat at her bed
        for hours
        talking to her,
        and then she opened her eyes
        and saw me:
        &quot;I knew it would be you,&quot;
        she said.
        then hse closed her
        eyes.

        the next day she was
        dead.

        I drank alone
        for two years
        after that.
        





        my friend, the parking lot attendant
        --he's a dandy
        --small moustache
        --usually sucking on a cigar
        he tends to lean into cars as he
        transacts business
        first time I met him, he said,
        "hey! ya gonna make a
        killin'?"
        "maybe," I answered.
        next meeting it was:
        "hey, Ramrod! what's
        happening?"
        "very little," I told
        him.
        next time I had my girlfriend with me
        and he just
        grinned.
        next time I was
        alone.
        "hey," he asked, "where's the young
        chick?"
        "I left her at home...."
        "<i>Bullshit</i>! I'll bet she dumped
        you!"
        and the next time
        he really leaned into the car:
        "what's a guy like <i>you</i> doing driving a
        BMW! I'll bet you inherited your
        money, you didn't get this car with your
        brains!"
        "how'd you guess?" I
        answered.
        that was some weeks ago.
        I haven't seen him lately.
        feIlow like that, chances are he just moved on
        to better
        things.


        





        My Groupie
        I read last Saturday in the
        redwoods outside of Santa Cruz
        and I was about 3/4's finished
        when I heard a long high scream
        and a quite attractive
        young girl came running toward me
        long gown &amp; divine eyes of fire
        and she leaped up on the stage
        and screamed: &quot;I WANT YOU!
        I WANT YOU! TAKE ME! TAKE
        ME!&quot;
        I told her, &quot;look, get the hell
        away from me.&quot;
        but she kept tearing at my
        clothing and throwing herself
        at me.
        &quot;where were you,&quot; I
        asked her, &quot;when I was living
        on one candy bar a day and
        sending short stories to the
        Atlantic Monthly?&quot;
        she grabbed my balls and almost
        twisted them off. her kisses
        tasted like shitsoup.
        2 women jumped up on the stage
        and
        carried her off into the
        woods.
        I could still hear her screams
        as I began the next poem.
        mabye, I thought, I should have
        taken her on stage in front
        of all those eyes.
        but one can never be sure
        whether it's good poetry or
        bad acid.
        





        New Mexico
        I was fairly drunk when it
        began and I took out my bottle and used it
        along the way. I was reading a week or two after
        Kandel and I did not look quite as
        pretty but
        I brought it off and we
        ended up at the Webbs, 6, 8, 10 of
        us, and I drank scotch, wine, beer, tequila
        and noticed a nice one sitting next to me -
        one tooth missing when she smiled,
        lovely, and I put my arm around her
        and began loading her with bullshit. when I awakened at 10 a.m. the next morning
        I was in a strange house
        in bed with this
        woman. she was asleep but looked
        familiar.

        I'll settle for the 6 horse
        





        Now
        I sit here on the 2nd floor
        hunched over in yellow
        pajamas
        still pretending to be
        a writer.
        some damned gall,
        at 71,
        my brain cells eaten
        away by
        life.
        rows of books
        behind me,
        I scratch my thinning
        hair
        and search for the
        word.
        





        O, We Are The Outcasts
        ah, christ, what a CREW:
        more
        poetry, always more
        P O E T R Y .
        if it doesn't come, coax it out with a
        laxative. get your name in LIGHTS,
        get it up there in
        8 1/2 x 11 mimeo.
        keep it coming like a miracle.
        ah christ, writers are the most sickening
        of all the louts!
        yellow-toothed, slump-shouldered,
        gutless, flea-bitten and
        obvious . . . in tinker-toy rooms
        with their flabby hearts
        they tell us
        what's wrong with the world-
        as if we didn't know that a cop's club
        can crack the head
        and that war is a dirtier game than
        marriage . . .
        or down in a basement bar
        hiding from a wife who doesn't appreciate him
        and children he doesn't
        want
        he tells us that his heart is drowning in
        vomit. hell, all our hearts are drowning in vomit,
        in pork salt, in bad verse, in soggy
        love.
        but he thinks he's alone and
        he thinks he's special and he thinks he's Rimbaud
        and he thinks he's
        Pound.
        and death! how about death? did you know
        that we all have to die? even Keats died, even
        Milton!
        and D. Thomas-THEY KILLED HIM, of course.
        Thomas didn't want all those free drinks
        all that free pussy-
        they . . . FORCED IT ON HIM
        when they should have left him alone so he could
        write write WRITE!
        poets.
        and there's another
        type. I've met them at their country
        places (don't ask me what I was doing there because

        I don't know).
        they were born with money and
        they don't have to dirty their hands in
        slaughterhouses or washing
        dishes in grease joints or
        driving cabs or pimping or selling pot.
        this gives them time to understand
        Life.
        they walk in with their cocktail glass
        held about heart high
        and when they drink they just
        sip.
        you are drinking green beer which you
        brought with you
        because you have found out through the years
        that rich bastards are tight-
        they use 5 cent stamps instead of airmail
        they promise to have all sorts of goodies ready
        upon your arrival
        from gallons of whisky to
        50 cent cigars. but it's never
        there.
        and they HIDE their women from you-
        their wives, x-wives, daughters, maids, so forth,
        because they've read your poems and
        figure all you want to do is fuck everybody and
        everything. which once might have been
        true but is no longer quite
        true.
        and-
        he WRITES TOO.
        POETRY, of
        course. everybody
        writes
        poetry.
        he has plenty of time and a
        postoffice box in town
        and he drives there 3 or 4 times a day
        looking and hoping for accepted
        poems.
        he thinks that poverty is a weakness of the
        soul.
        he thinks your mind is ill because you are
        drunk all the time and have to work in a

        factory 10 or 12 hours a
        night.
        he brings his wife in, a beauty, stolen from a
        poorer rich
        man.
        he lets you gaze for 30 seconds
        then hustles her
        out. she has been crying for some
        reason.
        you've got 3 or 4 days to linger in the
        guesthouse he says,
        &quot;come on over to dinner
        sometime.&quot;
        but he doesn't say when or
        where. and then you find out that you are not even
        IN HIS HOUSE.
        you are in
        ONE of his houses but
        his house is somewhere
        else-
        you don't know
        where.
        he even has x-wives in some of his
        houses.
        his main concern is to keep his x-wives away from
        you. he doesn't want to give up a
        damn thing. and you can't blame him:
        his x-wives are all young, stolen, kept,
        talented, well-dressed, schooled, with
        varying French-German accents.
        and!: they
        WRITE POETRY TOO. or
        PAINT. or
        fuck.
        but his big problem is to get down to that mail
        box in town to get back his
        rejected poems
        and to keep his eye on all the other mail boxes
        in all his other
        houses.
        meanwhile, the starving Indians
        sell beads and baskets in the streets of the small desert
        town.


        the Indians are not allowed in his houses
        not so much because they are a fuck-threat
        but because they are
        dirty and
        ignorant. dirty? I look down at my shirt
        with the beerstain on the front.
        ignorant? I light a 6 cent cigar and
        forget about
        it.
        he or they or somebody was supposed to meet me at
        the
        train station.
        of course, they weren't
        there. &quot;We'll be there to meet the great
        Poet!&quot;
        well, I looked around and didn't see any
        great poet. besides it was 7 a.m. and
        40 degrees. those things
        happen. the trouble was there were no
        bars open. nothing open. not even a
        jail.
        he's a poet.
        he's also a doctor, a head-shrinker.
        no blood involved that
        way. he won't tell me whether I am crazy or
        not-I don't have the
        money.
        he walks out with his cocktail glass
        disappears for 2 hours, 3 hours,
        then suddenly comes walking back in
        unannounced
        with the same cocktail glass
        to make sure I haven't gotten hold of
        something more precious than
        Life itself.
        my cheap green beer is killing
        me. he shows heart (hurrah) and
        gives me a little pill that stops my
        gagging.
        but nothing decent to
        drink.
        he'd bought a small 6 pack
        for my arrival but that was gone in an
        hour and 15
        minutes.

        &quot;I'll buy you barrels of beer,&quot; he had
        said.
        I used his phone (one of his phones)
        to get deliveries of beer and
        cheap whisky. the town was ten miles away,
        downhill. I peeled my poor dollars from my poor
        roll. and the boy needed a tip, of
        course.
        the way it was shaping up I could see that I was
        hardly Dylan Thomas yet, not even
        Robert Creeley. certainly Creeley wouldn't have
        had beerstains on his
        shirt.
        anyhow, when I finally got hold of one of his
        x-wives I was too drunk to
        make it.
        scared too. sure, I imagined him peering
        through the window-
        he didn't want to give up a damn thing-
        and
        leveling the luger while I was
        working
        while &quot;The March to the Gallows&quot; was playing over
        the Muzak
        and shooting me in the ass first and
        my poor brain
        later.
        &quot;an intruder,&quot; I could hear him telling them,
        &quot;ravishing one of my helpless x-wives.&quot;
        I see him published in some of the magazines
        now. not very good stuff.
        a poem about me
        too: the Polack.
        the Polack whines too much. the Polack whines about his
        country, other countries, all countries, the Polack
        works overtime in a factory like a fool, among other
        fools with &quot;pre-drained spirits.&quot;
        the Polack drinks seas of green beer
        full of acid. the Polack has an ulcerated
        hemorrhoid. the Polack picks on fags
        &quot;fragile fags.&quot; the Polack hates his
        wife, hates his daughter. his daughter will become
        an alcoholic, a prostitute. the Polack has an

        &quot;obese burned out wife.&quot; the Polack has a
        spastic gut. the Polack has a
        &quot;rectal brain.&quot;
        thank you, Doctor (and poet). any charge for
        this? I know I still owe you for the
        pill.
        Your poem is not too good
        but at least I got your starch up.
        most of your stuff is about as lively as a
        wet and deflated
        beachball. but it is your round, you've won a round.
        going to invite me out this
        Summer? I might scrape up
        trainfare. got an Indian friend who'd like to meet
        you and yours. he swears he's got the biggest
        pecker in the state of California.
        and guess what?
        he writes
        POETRY
        too!
        





        Oh Yes
        there are worse things than
        being alone
        but it often takes decades
        to realize this
        and most often
        when you do
        it's too late
        and there's nothing worse
        than
        too late.
        





        On Going Back To The Street After Viewing An Art Show
        they talk down through
        the centuries to us,
        and this we need more and more,
        the statues and paintings
        in midnight age
        as we go along
        holding dead hands.
        and we would say
        rather than delude the knowing:
        a damn good show,
        but hardly enough for a horse to eat,
        and out on the sunshine street where
        eyes are dabbled in metazoan faces
        i decide again
        that in theses centuries
        they have done very well
        considering the nature of their
        brothers:
        it's more than good
        that some of them,
        (closer really to the field-mouse than
        falcon)
        have been bold enough to try.

        one thirty-six a.m.
        I laugh sometimes when I think about
        say
        Cline at a typewriter
        or Dostoevsky...
        or Hamsun...
        ordinary men with feet, ears, eyes,
        ordinary men with hair on their heads
        sitting there typing words
        while having difficulties with life
        while being puzzled almost to madness.
        Dostoevsky gets up
        he leaves the machine to piss,
        comes back
        drinks a glass of milk and thinks about
        the casino and
        the roulette wheel.
        Cline stops, gets up, walks to the
        window, looks out, thinks, my last patient
        died today, I won't have to make any more
        visits there.
        when I saw him last
        he paid his doctor bill;
        it's those who don't pay their bills,
        they live on and on.
        Cline walks back, sits down at the
        machine
        is still for a good two minutes
        then begins to type.
        Hamsun stands over his machine thinking,
        I wonder if they are going to believe
        all these things I write?
        he sits down, begins to type.
        he doesn't know what a writer's block
        is:
        he's a prolific son-of-a-bitch
        damn near as magnificent as
        the sun.
        he types away.
        and I laugh
        not out loud
        but all up and down these walls, these
        dirty yellow and blue walls
        my white cat asleep on the
        table
        hiding his eyes from the
        light.
        he's not alone tonight

        and neither am
        I.
        





        Out Of The Arm Of One Love...
        out of the arm of one love
        and into the arms of another
        





        Paris
        never
        even in calmer times
        have I ever
        dreamed of
        bicycling through that
        city
        wearing a
        beret
        and
        Camus
        always
        pissed
        me

        Poem For My 43rd Birthday
        To end up alone
        in a tomb of a room
        without cigarettes
        or wine--
        just a lightbulb
        and a potbelly,
        grayhaired,
        and glad to have
        the room.

        Prayer In Bad Weather
        by God, I don't know what to
        





        Pull A String, A Puppet Moves
        each man must realize
        that it can all disappear very
        quickly:
        the cat, the woman, the job,
        the front tire,
        the bed, the walls, the
        room; all our necessities
        including love,
        rest on foundations of sand -
        and any given cause,
        no matter how unrelated:
        the death of a boy in Hong Kong
        or a blizzard in Omaha ...
        can serve as your undoing.
        all your chinaware crashing to the
        kitchen floor, your girl will enter
        and you'll be standing, drunk,
        in the center of it and she'll ask:
        my god, what's the matter?
        and you'll answer: I don't know,
        I don't know ...
        





        Question And Answer
        he sat naked and drunk in a room of summer
        night, running the blade of the knife
        under his fingernails, smiling, thinking
        of all the letters he had received
        telling him that
        the way he lived and wrote about
        that--
        it had kept them going when
        all seemed
        truly
        hopeless.

        Rain Or Shine
        the vultures at the zoo
        (all three of them)
        sit very quietly in their
        caged tree
        and below
        on the ground
        are chunks of rotten meat.
        the vultures are over-full.
        our taxes have fed them
        well.
        we move on to the next
        cage.
        a man is in there
        sitting on the ground
        eating
        his own shit.
        i recognize him as
        our former mailman.
        his favorite expression
        had been:
        "have a beautiful day."
        that day i did.
        





        Raw With Love
        little dark girl with
        kind eyes
        when it comes time to
        use the knife
        I won't flinch and
        I won't blame
        you,
        as I drive along the shore alone
        as the palms wave,
        the ugly heavy palms,
        as the living does not arrive
        as the dead do not leave,
        I won't blame you,
        instead
        I will remember the kisses
        our lips raw with love
        and how you gave me
        everything you had
        and how I
        offered you what was left of
        me,
        and I will remember your small room
        the feel of you
        the light in the window
        your records
        your books
        our morning coffee
        our noons our nights
        our bodies spilled together
        sleeping
        the tiny flowing currents
        immediate and forever
        your leg my leg
        your arm my arm
        your smile and the warmth
        of you
        who made me laugh
        again.
        little dark girl with kind eyes
        you have no
        knife. the knife is
        mine and I won't use it
        yet.
        





        Revolt In The Ranks
        I have just spent one-hour-and-a-half
        handicapping tomorrow's
        card.
        when am I going to get at the poems?
        well, they'll just have to wait
        they'll have to warm their feet in the
        anteroom
        where they'll sit gossiping about
        me.
        &quot;this Chinaski, doesn't he realize that
        without us he would have long ago
        gone mad, been dead?&quot;
        &quot;he knows, but he thinks he can keep
        us at his beck and call!&quot;
        &quot;he's an ingrate!&quot;
        &quot;let's give him writer's block!&quot;
        &quot;yeah!&quot;
        &quot;yeah!&quot;
        &quot;yeah!&quot;
        the little poems kick up their heels
        and laugh.
        then the biggest one gets up and
        walks toward the door.
        &quot;hey, where are you going?&quot; he is
        asked.
        &quot;somewhere where I am
        appreciated.&quot;
        then, he
        and the others
        vanish.
        





        Rhyming Poem
        the goldfish sing all night with guitars,
        and the whores go down with the stars,
        the whores go down with the stars
        





        Shoes
        when you're young
        a pair of
        female
        high-heeled shoes
        just sitting
        alone
        in the closet
        can fire your
        bones;
        when you're old
        it's just
        a pair of shoes
        without
        anybody
        in them
        and
        just as
        well.
        





        Short Order
        I took my girlfriend to your last poetry reading,
        she said.
        yes, yes? I asked.
        she's young and pretty, she said.
        and? I asked.
        she hated your
        guts.
        





        Show Biz
        I can't have it
        and you can't have it
        and we won't
        get it
        so don't bet on it
        or even think about
        it
        just get out of bed
        each morning
        wash
        shave
        clothe
        yourself
        and go out into
        it
        because
        outside of that
        all that's left is
        suicide and
        madness
        so you just
        can't
        expect too much
        you can't even
        expect
        so what you do
        is
        work from a modest
        minimal
        base
        like when you
        walk outside
        be glad your car
        might possibly
        be there
        and if it is-
        that the tires
        aren't
        flat
        then you get
        in
        and if it

        starts--you
        start.
        and
        it's the damndest
        movie
        you've ever
        seen
        because
        you're
        in it--
        low budget
        and
        4 billion
        critics
        and the longest
        run
        you ever hope
        for
        is
        one
        day.

        Sleep
        she was a short one
        getting fat and she had once been
        beautiful and
        she drank the wine
        she drank the wine in bed and
        talked and screamed and cursed at
        me
        and i told her
        





        small conversation in the afternoon with John Fante
        he said, "I was working in Hollywood when Faulkner was
        working in Hollywood and he was
        the worst: he was too drunk to stand up at the
        end of the afternoon and so I had to help him
        into a taxi
        day after day after day.
        "but when he left Hollywood, I stayed on, and while I
        didn't drink like that maybe I should have, I might have
        had the guts then to follow him and get the hell out of
        there."
        I told him, "you write as well as
        Faulkner.:
        "you mean that?" he asked from the hospital
        bed, smiling.
        





        So Now?
        the words have come and gone,
        I sit ill.
        the phone rings, the cats sleep.
        Linda vacuums.
        I am waiting to live,
        waiting to die.
        





        Some People
        some people never go crazy.
        me, sometimes I'll lie down behind the couch
        for 3 or 4 days.
        they'll find me there.
        it's Cherub, they'll say, and
        they pour wine down my throat
        rub my chest
        sprinkle me with oils.

        Something For The Touts, The Nuns, The Grocery Clerks, And You . . .
        we have everything and we have nothing
        and some men do it in churches
        and some men do it by tearing butterflies
        in half
        and some men do it in Palm Springs
        laying it into butterblondes
        with Cadillac souls
        Cadillacs and butterflies
        nothing and everything,
        the face melting down to the last puff
        in a cellar in Corpus Christi.
        there's something for the touts, the nuns,
        the grocery clerks and you . . .
        something at 8 a.m., something in the library
        something in the river,
        everything and nothing.
        in the slaughterhouse it comes running along
        the ceiling on a hook, and you swing it --
        one
        two
        three
        and then you've got it, $200 worth of dead
        meat, its bones against your bones
        something and nothing.
        it's always early enough to die and
        it's always too late,
        and the drill of blood in the basin white
        it tells you nothing at all
        and the gravediggers playing poker over
        5 a.m. coffee, waiting for the grass
        to dismiss the frost . . .
        they tell you nothing at all.
        we have everything and we have nothing --
        days with glass edges and the impossible stink
        of river moss -- worse than shit;
        checkerboard days of moves and countermoves,
        fagged interest, with as much sense in defeat as
        in victory; slow days like mules
        humping it slagged and sullen and sun-glazed
        up a road where a madman sits waiting among
        bluejays and wrens netted in and sucked a flakey
        grey.
        good days too of wine and shouting, fights
        in alleys, fat legs of women striving around
        your bowels buried in moans,
        the signs in bullrings like diamonds hollering
        Mother Capri, violets coming out of the ground
        telling you to forget the dead armies and the loves
        that robbed you.
        days when children say funny and brilliant things
        like savages trying to send you a message through

        their bodies while their bodies are still
        alive enough to transmit and feel and run up
        and down without locks and paychecks and
        ideals and possessions and beetle-like
        opinions.
        days when you can cry all day long in
        a green room with the door locked, days
        when you can laugh at the breadman
        because his legs are too long, days
        of looking at hedges . . .
        and nothing, and nothing, the days of
        the bosses, yellow men
        with bad breath and big feet, men
        who look like frogs, hyenas, men who walk
        as if melody had never been invented, men
        who think it is intelligent to hire and fire and
        profit, men with expensive wives they possess
        like 60 acres of ground to be drilled
        or shown-off or to be walled away from
        the incompetent, men who'd kill you
        because they're crazy and justify it because
        it's the law, men who stand in front of
        windows 30 feet wide and see nothing,
        men with luxury yachts who can sail around
        the world and yet never get out of their vest
        pockets, men like snails, men like eels, men
        like slugs, and not as good . . .
        and nothing, getting your last paycheck
        at a harbor, at a factory, at a hospital, at an
        aircraft plant, at a penny arcade, at a
        barbershop, at a job you didn't want
        anyway.
        income tax, sickness, servility, broken
        arms, broken heads -- all the stuffing
        come out like an old pillow.
        we have everything and we have nothing.
        some do it well enough for a while and
        then give way. fame gets them or disgust
        or age or lack of proper diet or ink
        across the eyes or children in college
        or new cars or broken backs while skiing
        in Switzerland or new politics or new wives
        or just natural change and decay --
        the man you knew yesterday hooking
        for ten rounds or drinking for three days and
        three nights by the Sawtooth mountains now
        just something under a sheet or a cross
        or a stone or under an easy delusion,
        or packing a bible or a golf bag or a
        briefcase: how they go, how they go! -- all

        the ones you thought would never go.
        days like this. like your day today.
        maybe the rain on the window trying to
        get through to you. what do you see today?
        what is it? where are you? the best
        days are sometimes the first, sometimes
        the middle and even sometimes the last.
        the vacant lots are not bad, churches in
        Europe on postcards are not bad. people in
        wax museums frozen into their best sterility
        are not bad, horrible but not bad. the
        cannon, think of the cannon, and toast for
        breakfast the coffee hot enough you
        know your tongue is still there, three
        geraniums outside a window, trying to be
        red and trying to be pink and trying to be
        geraniums, no wonder sometimes the women
        cry, no wonder the mules don't want
        to go up the hill. are you in a hotel room
        in Detroit looking for a cigarette? one more
        good day. a little bit of it. and as
        the nurses come out of the building after
        their shift, having had enough, eight nurses
        with different names and different places
        to go -- walking across the lawn, some of them
        want cocoa and a paper, some of them want a
        hot bath, some of them want a man, some
        of them are hardly thinking at all. enough
        and not enough. arcs and pilgrims, oranges
        gutters, ferns, antibodies, boxes of
        tissue paper.
        in the most decent sometimes sun
        there is the softsmoke feeling from urns
        and the canned sound of old battleplanes
        and if you go inside and run your finger
        along the window ledge you'll find
        dirt, maybe even earth.
        and if you look out the window
        there will be the day, and as you
        get older you'll keep looking
        keep looking
        sucking your tongue in a little
        ah ah no no maybe
        some do it naturally
        some obscenely
        everywhere.

        splash
        the illusion is that you are simply
        reading this poem.
        the reality is that this is
        more than a
        poem.
        this is a beggar's knife.
        this is a tulip.
        this is a soldier marching
        through Madrid.
        this is you on your
        death bed.
        this is Li Po laughing
        underground.
        this is not a god-damned
        poem.
        this is a horse asleep.
        a butterfly in
        your brain.
        this is the devil's
        circus.
        you are not reading this
        on a page.
        the page is reading
        you.
        feel it?
        it's like a cobra. it's a hungry eagle circling the room.
        this is not a poem. poems are dull,
        they make you sleep.
        these words force you
        to a new
        madness.
        you have been blessed, you have been pushed into a
        blinding area of
        light.
        the elephant dreams
        with you
        now.
        the curve of space
        bends and
        laughs.
        you can die now.
        you can die now as
        people were meant to
        die:
        great,
        victorious,
        hearing the music,

        being the music,
        roaring,
        roaring,
        roaring.
        





        Sway With Me
        sway with me, everything sad --
        madmen in stone houses
        without doors,
        lepers steaming love and song
        frogs trying to figure
        the sky;
        sway with me, sad things --
        fingers split on a forge
        old age like breakfast shell
        used books, used people
        used flowers, used love
        I need you
        I need you
        I need you:
        it has run away
        like a horse or a dog,
        dead or lost
        or unforgiving.

        The Aliens
        you may not believe it
        but there are people
        who go through life with
        very little
        friction or
        distress.
        they dress well, eat
        well, sleep well.
        they are contented with
        their family
        life.
        they have moments of
        grief
        but all in all
        they are undisturbed
        and often feel
        very good.
        and when they die
        it is an easy
        death, usually in their
        sleep.
        





        The Blackbirds are Rough Today
        lonely as a dry and used orchard
        spread over the earth
        for use and surrender.
        shot down like an ex-pug selling
        dailies on the corner.
        taken by tears like
        an aging chorus girl
        who has gotten her last check.
        a hanky is in order your lord your
        worship.
        the blackbirds are rough today
        like
        ingrown toenails
        in an overnight
        jail---
        wine wine whine,
        the blackbirds run around and
        fly around
        harping about
        Spanish melodies and bones.
        and everywhere is
        nowhere---
        the dream is as bad as
        flapjacks and flat tires:
        why do we go on
        with our minds and
        pockets full of
        dust
        like a bad boy just out of
        school---
        you tell
        me,
        you who were a hero in some
        revolution
        you who teach children
        you who drink with calmness
        you who own large homes
        and walk in gardens
        you who have killed a man and own a
        beautiful wife
        you tell me
        why I am on fire like old dry
        garbage.
        we might surely have some interesting
        correspondence.

        it will keep the mailman busy.
        and the butterflies and ants and bridges and
        cemeteries
        the rocket-makers and dogs and garage mechanics
        will still go on a
        while
        until we run out of stamps
        and/or
        ideas.
        don't be ashamed of
        anything; I guess God meant it all
        like
        locks on
        doors.
        





        the crunch
        too much too little
        too fat
        too thin
        or nobody.
        laughter or
        tears
        haters
        lovers
        strangers with faces like
        the backs of
        thumb tacks
        armies running through
        streets of blood
        waving winebottles
        bayoneting and fucking
        virgins.
        an old guy in a cheap room
        with a photograph of M. Monroe.
        there is a loneliness in this world so great
        that you can see it in the slow movement of
        the hands of a clock
        people so tired
        mutilated
        either by love or no love.
        people just are not good to each other
        one on one.
        the rich are not good to the rich
        the poor are not good to the poor.
        we are afraid.
        our educational system tells us
        that we can all be
        big-ass winners
        it hasn't told us
        about the gutters
        or the suicides.
        or the terror of one person
        aching in one place
        alone

        untouched
        unspoken to
        watering a plant.
        people are not good to each other.
        people are not good to each other.
        people are not good to each other.
        I suppose they never will be.
        I don't ask them to be.
        but sometimes I think about
        it.
        the beads will swing
        the clouds will cloud
        and the killer will behead the child
        like taking a bite out of an ice cream cone.
        too much
        too little
        too fat
        too thin
        or nobody
        more haters than lovers.
        people are not good to each other.
        perhaps if they were
        our deaths would not be so sad.
        meanwhile I look at young girls
        stems
        flowers of chance.
        there must be a way.
        surely there must be a way that we have not yet
        though of.
        who put this brain inside of me?
        it cries
        it demands
        it says that there is a chance.
        it will not say
        "no."


        





        The Genius Of The Crowd
        there is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average
        human being to supply any given army on any given day
        and the best at murder are those who preach against it
        and the best at hate are those who preach love
        and the best at war finally are those who preach peace
        those who preach god, need god
        those who preach peace do not have peace
        those who preach peace do not have love
        beware the preachers
        beware the knowers
        beware those who are always reading books
        beware those who either detest poverty
        or are proud of it
        beware those quick to praise
        for they need praise in return
        beware those who are quick to censor
        they are afraid of what they do not know
        beware those who seek constant crowds for
        they are nothing alone
        beware the average man the average woman
        beware their love, their love is average
        seeks average
        but there is genius in their hatred
        there is enough genius in their hatred to kill you
        to kill anybody
        not wanting solitude
        not understanding solitude
        they will attempt to destroy anything
        that differs from their own
        not being able to create art
        they will not understand art
        they will consider their failure as creators
        only as a failure of the world
        not being able to love fully
        they will believe your love incomplete
        and then they will hate you
        and their hatred will be perfect
        like a shining diamond
        like a knife
        like a mountain
        like a tiger
        like hemlock
        their finest art

        the German hotel
        the German hotel was very strange and expensive and had
        double doors to the rooms, very thick doors, and it over-
        looked the park and the vasser tern and in the mornings
        it was usually too late for breakfast and the maids
        would be everywhere changing sheets and bringing in
        towels, but you never saw any hotel guests, only the
        maids and the desk man and the day desk man was all
        right because we were sober during the day but we had
        trouble with the night man who was some sort of snob
        and not very good with getting the corkscrews and ice
        and wine glasses up to us and he was always phoning to
        say the other guests objected to our noise.
        what other guests?
        I always told him that everything was very quiet,
        nothing was going on, that somebody must be crazy, so
        will you please stop ringing?
        but he kept ringing, he became almost like a
        companion to us through the night.
        but the day man was very nice, he always had little
        messages of importance that either meant money, or a
        good friend coming to see us, or both.
        we stayed at the hotel twice during our trip to
        Europe and each time we checked out the day clerk
        bowed ever so slightly, he was tall and well-dressed
        and pleasant and he said each time: "it was nice to
        have you with us. please come here again if you return."
        "thank you," we said, "thank you."
        it's our favorite hotel and if I ever get rich I am
        going to buy it and fire the night clerk and there will
        be enough ice cubes and corkscrews for everybody.
        





        the great slob
        I was always a natural slob
        I liked to lay upon the bed
        in undershirt (stained, of
        course) (and with cigarette
        holes)
        shoes off
        beerbottle in hand
        trying to shake off a
        difficult night, say with a
        woman still around
        walking the floor
        complaining about this and
        that,
        and I'd work up a
        belch and say, "HEY, YOU DON'T
        LIKE IT? THEN GET YOUR ASS
        OUT OF HERE!"
        I really loved myself, I
        really loved my slob-
        self, and
        they seemed to also:
        always leaving
        but almost
        always
        coming
        back.
        





        The History Of One Tough Motherfucker
        he came to the door one night wet thin beaten and
        terrorized
        a white cross-eyed tailless cat
        I took him in and fed him and he stayed
        grew to trust me until a friend drove up the driveway
        and ran him over
        I took what was left to a vet who said,&quot;not much
        chance...give him these pills...his backbone
        is crushed, but is was crushed before and somehow
        mended, if he lives he'll never walk, look at
        these x-rays, he's been shot, look here, the pellets
        are still there...also, he once had a tail, somebody
        cut it off...&quot;
        





        The House
        They are building a house
        half a block down
        and I sit up here
        with the shades down
        listening to the sounds,
        the hammers pounding in nails,
        thack thack thack thack,
        and then I hear birds,
        and thack thack thack,
        and I go to bed,
        I pull the covers to my throat;
        they have been building this house
        for a month, and soon it will have
        its people...sleeping, eating,
        loving, moving around,
        but somehow
        now
        it is not right,
        there seems a madness,
        men walk on top with nails
        in their mouths
        and I read about Castro and Cuba,
        and at night I walk by
        and the ribs of the house show
        and inside I can see cats walking
        the way cats walk,
        and then a boy rides by on a bicycle
        and still the house is not done
        and in the morning the men
        will be back
        walking around on the house
        with their hammers,
        and it seems people should not build houses
        anymore,
        it seems people should not get married
        anymore,
        it seems people should stop working
        and sit in small rooms
        on 2nd floors
        under electric lights without shades;
        it seems there is a lot to forget
        and a lot not to do,
        and in drugstores, markets, bars,
        the people are tired, they do not want
        to move, and I stand there at night
        and look through this house and the
        house does not want to be built;
        through its sides I can see the purple hills
        and the first lights of evening,
        and it is cold
        and I button my coat
        and I stand there looking through the house

        and the cats stop and look at me
        until I am embarrased
        and move North up the sidewalk
        where I will buy
        cigarettes and beer
        and return to my room.
        





        The Icecream People
        the lady has me temporarily off the bottle
        and now the pecker stands up
        better.
        however, things change overnight--
        instead of listening to Shostakovich and
        Mozart through a smeared haze of smoke
        the nights change, new
        complexities:
        we drive to Baskin-Robbins,
        31 flavors:
        Rocky Road, Bubble Gum, Apricot Ice, Strawberry
        Cheesecake, Chocolate Mint...
        we park outside and look at icecream
        people
        a very healthy and satisfied people,
        nary a potential suicide in sight
        (they probably even vote)
        and I tell her
        "what if the boys saw me go in there? suppose they
        find out I'm going in for a walnut peach sundae?"
        "come on, chicken," she laughs and we go in
        and stand with the icecream people.
        none of them are cursing or threatening
        the clerks.
        there seem to be no hangovers or
        grievances.
        I am alarmed at the placid and calm wave
        that flows about. I feel like a leper in a
        beauty contest. we finally get our sundaes and
        sit in the car and eat them.
        I must admit they are quite good. a curious new
        world. (all my friends tell me I am looking
        better. "you're looking good, man, we thought you
        were going to die there for a while...")
        --those 4,500 dark nights, the jails, the
        hospitals...
        and later that night
        there is use for the pecker, use for
        love, and it is glorious,
        long and true,
        and afterwards we speak of easy things;
        our heads by the open window with the moonlight
        looking through, we sleep in each other's
        arms.
        the icecream people make me feel good,
        inside and out.

        the lucky ones
        stuck in the rain on the freeway, 6:15 p.m.,
        these are the lucky ones, these are the
        dutifully employed, most with their radios on as loud
        as possible as they try not to think or remember.
        this is our new civilization: as men
        once lived in trees and caves now they live
        in their automobiles and on freeways as
        the local news is heard again and again while
        we shift from first gear to second and back to first.
        there's a poor fellow stalled in the fast lane ahead, hood
        up, he's standing against the freeway fence
        a newspaper over his head in the rain.
        the other cars force their way around his car, pull out into
        the next lane in front of cars determined to shut them off.
        in the lane to my right a driver is being followed by a
        police car with blinking red and blue lights - he surely
        can't be <i>speeding</i> as
        suddenly the rain comes down in a giant wash and all the
        cars stop and
        even with the windows up I can smell somebody's clutch
        burning.
        I just hope it's not mine as
        the wall of water diminishes and we go back into first
        gear; we are all still
        a long way from home as I memorize
        the silhouette of the car in front of me and the shape of the
        driver's head or
        what
        I can see of it above the headrest while
        his bumper sticker asks me
        HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR KID TODAY?
        suddenly I have an urge to scream
        as another wall of water comes down and the
        man on the radio announces that there will be a 70 percent
        chance of showers tomorrow night
        





        The Meek Shall Inherit The Earth
        if I suffer at this
        typewriter
        think how I'd feel
        among the lettuce-
        pickers of Salinas?

        The Sun Weilds Mercy
        and the sun weilds mercy

        and rockets leap like toads,
        and the boys get out the maps
        and pin-cuishon the moon,
        old green cheese,
        no life there but too much on earth:
        our unwashed India boys
        crosssing their legs,playing pipes,
        starving with sucked in bellies,
        watching the snakes volute
        like beautiful women in the hungry air;
        the rockets leap,
        the rockets leap like hares,
        clearing clump and dog
        replacing out-dated bullets;
        the Chineses still carve
        in jade,quietly stuffing rice
        into their hunger, a hunger
        a thousand years old,
        their muddy rivers moving with fire
        and song, barges, houseboats
        pushed by drifting poles
        of waiting without wanting;
        in Turkey they face the East
        on their carpets
        praying to a purple god
        who smokes and laughs
        and sticks fingers in their eyes
        blinding them, as gods will do;
        but the rockets are ready: peace is no longer,
        for some reason,precious;
        madness drifts like lily pads
        on a pond circling senselessly;
        the painters paint dipping
        their reds and greens and yellows,

        scrabbling in pits over bits

        of helmet, instrument and glass;

        lovers lie entwined and lost
        and sick as peace;

        flowers open as they always have
        opened but covered with thin dust
        of rocket fuel and mushrooms,
        poison mushrooms; it's a bad time,

        leaders, by poets , doctors, comedians,
        by manufacturers of soup
        and biscuits, Janus-faced hucksters
        of their own indexerity;
        I can now see now the coal-slick
        contanminated fields, a snail or 2,
        bile, obsidian, a fish or 3
        in the shallows, an obloquy of our
        source and our sight.....
        has this happend before? is history
        a circle that catches itself by the tail,
        a dream, a nightmare,

        These Things
        these things that we support most well
        have nothing to do with up,
        and we do with them
        out of boredom or fear or money
        or cracked intelligence;
        our circle and our candle of light
        being small,
        so small we cannot bear it,
        we heave out with Idea
        and lose the Center:
        all wax without the wick,
        and we see names that once meant
        wisdom,
        like signs into ghost towns,
        and only the graves are real.

        This
        self-congratulatory nonsense as the
        





        Three Oranges
        first time my father overheard me listening to
        this bit of music he asked me,
        &quot;what is it?&quot;
        &quot;it's called Love For Three Oranges,&quot;
        I informed him.
        &quot;boy,&quot; he said, &quot;that's getting it
        cheap.&quot;
        he meant sex.
        listening to it
        I always imagined three oranges
        sitting there,
        you know how orange they can
        get,
        so mightily orange.
        maybe Prokofiev had meant
        what my father
        thought.
        if so, I preferred it the
        other way
        the most horrible thing
        I could think of
        was part of me being
        what ejaculated out of the
        end of his
        stupid penis.
        I will never forgive him
        for that,
        his trick that I am stuck
        with,
        I find no nobility in
        parenthood.
        I say kill the Father
        before he makes more
        such as
        I.

        are you trying to crush me out like the rest of them?
        why didn't you take my money? they usually do
        from the sleeping drunken pants sick in the corner.
        next time take my left arm or a fifty
        but not my poems:
        I'm not Shakespeare
        but sometime simply
        there won't be any more, abstract or otherwise;
        there'll always be mony and whores and drunkards
        down to the last bomb,
        but as God said,
        crossing his legs,
        I see where I have made plenty of poets
        but not so very much
        poetry.

        True Story
        they found him walking along the freeway
        all red in
        front
        he had taken a rusty tin can
        and cut off his sexual
        machinery
        as if to say --
        see what you've done to
        me? you might as well have the
        rest.
        and he put part of him
        in one pocket and
        part of him in
        another
        and that's how they found him,
        walking
        along.
        they gave him over to the
        doctors
        who tried to sew the parts
        back
        on
        but the parts were
        quite contented
        the way they
        were.
        I think sometimes of all of the good
        ass
        turned over to the
        monsters of the
        world.
        maybe it was his protest against
        this or
        his protest
        against
        everything.

        What A Writer
        what i liked about e.e. cummings
        was that he cut away from
        the holiness of the
        word
        and with charm
        and gamble
        gave us lines
        that sliced through the
        dung.
        how it was needed!
        how we were withering
        away
        in the old
        tired
        manner.
        of course, then came all
        the e.e. cummings
        copyists.
        they copied him then
        as the others had
        copied Keats, Shelly,
        Swinburne, Byron, et
        al.
        but there was only
        one
        e.e. cummings.
        of course.
        one sun.
        one moon.
        





        What Can We Do?
        at their best, there is gentleness in Humanity.
        some understanding and, at times, acts of
        courage
        but all in all it is a mass, a glob that doesn't
        have too much.
        it is like a large animal deep in sleep and
        almost nothing can awaken it.
        when activated it's best at brutality,
        selfishness, unjust judgments, murder.
        





        Whats The Use Of A Title?
        They don't make it
        the beautiful die in flame-
        suicide pills, rat poison, rope what-
        ever...
        they rip their arms off,
        throw themselves out of windows,
        they pull their eyes out of the sockets,
        reject love
        reject hate
        reject, reject.
        they don't make it
        the beautiful can't endure,
        they are butterflies
        they are doves
        they are sparrows,
        they don't make it.
        one tall shot of flame
        while the old men play checkers in the park
        one flame, one good flame
        while the old men play checkers in the park
        in the sun.
        the beautiful are found in the edge of a room
        crumpled into spiders and needles and silence
        and we can never understand why they
        left, they were so
        beautiful.
        they don't make it,
        the beautiful die young
        and leave the ugly to their ugly lives.
        lovely and brilliant: life and suicide and death
        as the old men play checkers in the sun
        in the park.

        Young in New Orleans
        starving there, sitting around the bars,
        and at night walking the streets for
        hours,
        the moonlight always seemed fake
        to me, maybe it was,
        and in the French Quarter I watched
        the horses and buggies going by,
        everybody sitting high in the open
        carriages, the black driver, and in
        back the man and the woman,
        usually young and always white.
        and I was always white.
        and hardly charmed by the
        world.
        New Orleans was a place to
        hide.
        I could piss away my life,
        unmolested.
        except for the rats.
        the rats in my dark small room
        very much resented sharing it
        with me.
        they were large and fearless
        and stared at me with eyes
        that spoke
        an unblinking
        death.
        women were beyond me.
        they saw something
        depraved.
        there was one waitress
        a little older than
        I, she rather smiled,
        lingered when she
        brought my
        coffee.
        that was plenty for
        me, that was
        enough.
        there was something about
        that city, though
        it didn't let me feel guilty
        that I had no feeling for the
        things so many others
        needed.
        it let me alone.
        sitting up in my bed
        the llights out,

        hearing the outside
        sounds,
        lifting my cheap
        bottle of wine,
        letting the warmth of
        the grape
        enter
        me
        as I heard the rats
        moving about the
        room,
        I preferred them
        to
        humans.
        being lost,
        being crazy maybe
        is not so bad
        if you can be
        that way
        undisturbed.
        New Orleans gave me
        that.
        nobody ever called
        my name.
        no telephone,
        no car,
        no job,
        no
        anything.
        me and the
        rats
        and my youth,
        one time,
        that time
        I knew
        even through the
        nothingness,
        it was a
        celebration
        of something not to
        do
        but only
        know.
        





  From fairest creatures we desire increase,
  That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
  But as the riper should by time decease,
  His tender heir might bear his memory:
  But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
  Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
  Making a famine where abundance lies,
  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
  Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
  And only herald to the gaudy spring,
  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
  And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
    To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

  II

  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
  Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
  Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:
  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
  To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,
  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
  How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,
  If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'
  Proving his beauty by succession thine!
    This were to be new made when thou art old,
    And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.

  III

  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
  Now is the time that face should form another;
  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
  For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
  Of his self-love to stop posterity?
  Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
  Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
    But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
    Die single and thine image dies with thee.

  IV

  Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
  Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
  Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
  And being frank she lends to those are free:
  Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
  The bounteous largess given thee to give?
  Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
  So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
  For having traffic with thy self alone,
  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:
  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
    Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
    Which, used, lives th' executor to be.

  V

  Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
  Will play the tyrants to the very same
  And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
  For never-resting time leads summer on
  To hideous winter, and confounds him there;
  Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,
  Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
  Then were not summer's distillation left,
  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
  Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
  Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:
    But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,
    Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.


  VI

  Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
  In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
  With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.
  That use is not forbidden usury,
  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
  That's for thy self to breed another thee,
  Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
  If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:
  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
  Leaving thee living in posterity?
    Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
    To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.

  VII

  Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
  Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
  And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,
  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
  But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
  Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,
  The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
  From his low tract, and look another way:
    So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:
    Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.

  VIII

  Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
  Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
  Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
  By unions married, do offend thine ear,
  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
  Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
  Resembling sire and child and happy mother,
  Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
    Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'

  IX

  Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
  That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
  Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;
  The world will be thy widow and still weep
  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
  When every private widow well may keep
  By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
  Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend
  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
  But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
  And kept unused the user so destroys it.
    No love toward others in that bosom sits
    That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.

  X

  For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
  Who for thy self art so unprovident.
  Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,
  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
  For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,
  That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
  Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
  O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:
  Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?
  Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
  Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
    Make thee another self for love of me,
    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.

  XI

  As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,
  In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
  Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,
  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;
  Without this folly, age, and cold decay:
  If all were minded so, the times should cease
  And threescore year would make the world away.
  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
  Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;
  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
    She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.

  XII

  When I do count the clock that tells the time,
  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
  When I behold the violet past prime,
  And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;
  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
  And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,
  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
  Then of thy beauty do I question make,
  That thou among the wastes of time must go,
  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
  And die as fast as they see others grow;
    And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
    Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.

  XIII

  O! that you were your self; but, love you are
  No longer yours, than you your self here live:
  Against this coming end you should prepare,
  And your sweet semblance to some other give:
  So should that beauty which you hold in lease
  Find no determination; then you were
  Yourself again, after yourself's decease,
  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
  Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
  And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
    O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,
    You had a father: let your son say so.

  XIV

  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;
  And yet methinks I have astronomy,
  But not to tell of good or evil luck,
  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
  Or say with princes if it shall go well
  By oft predict that I in heaven find:
  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
  And constant stars in them I read such art
  As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,
  If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';
    Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
    'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'

  XV

  When I consider every thing that grows
  Holds in perfection but a little moment,
  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
  When I perceive that men as plants increase,
  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  And wear their brave state out of memory;
  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
  Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
  To change your day of youth to sullied night,
    And all in war with Time for love of you,
    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.

  XVI

  But wherefore do not you a mightier way
  Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
  And fortify your self in your decay
  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
  And many maiden gardens, yet unset,
  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
  So should the lines of life that life repair,
  Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
    To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,
    And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.

  XVII

  Who will believe my verse in time to come,
  If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
  The age to come would say 'This poet lies;
  Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
  So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,
  Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,
  And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
  And stretched metre of an antique song:
    But were some child of yours alive that time,
    You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.

  XVIII

  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
  And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
  And every fair from fair sometime declines,
  By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
  Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
  When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

  XIX

  Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
  And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;
  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
  And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
  To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
  O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
  Him in thy course untainted do allow
  For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
    Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
    My love shall in my verse ever live young.

  XX

  A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
  Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;
  A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
  With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:
  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
  A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,
  Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
  And for a woman wert thou first created;
  Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
  And by addition me of thee defeated,
  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
    But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
    Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.

  XXI

  So is it not with me as with that Muse,
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
  Making a couplement of proud compare'
  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
  With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,
  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
  O! let me, true in love, but truly write,
  And then believe me, my love is as fair
  As any mother's child, though not so bright
  As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
    Let them say more that like of hearsay well;
    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.

  XXII

  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
  So long as youth and thou are of one date;
  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
  Then look I death my days should expiate.
  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
  How can I then be elder than thou art?
  O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary
  As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
  Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
    Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.

  XXIII

  As an unperfect actor on the stage,
  Who with his fear is put beside his part,
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
  So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
  O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.
  O! let my looks be then the eloquence
  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
  More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
    O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:
    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.

  XXIV

  Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,
  Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  And perspective it is best painter's art.
  For through the painter must you see his skill,
  To find where your true image pictur'd lies,
  Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.

  XXV

  Let those who are in favour with their stars
  Of public honour and proud titles boast,
  Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
  But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
  And in themselves their pride lies buried,
  For at a frown they in their glory die.
  The painful warrior famoused for fight,
  After a thousand victories once foil'd,
  Is from the book of honour razed quite,
  And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
  Then happy I, that love and am belov'd,
  Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.

  XXVI

  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
  To thee I send this written embassage,
  To witness duty, not to show my wit:
  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
  But that I hope some good conceit of thine
  In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:
  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
  And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.

  XXVII

  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
  The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;
  But then begins a journey in my head
  To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
  For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--
  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
  Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
  Save that my soul's imaginary sight
  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
  Which, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,
  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
    Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
    For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.

  XXVIII

  How can I then return in happy plight,
  That am debarre'd the benefit of rest?
  When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,
  But day by night and night by day oppress'd,
  And each, though enemies to either's reign,
  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
  The one by toil, the other to complain
  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
  I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,
  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
  So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,
  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
    And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.

  XXIX

  When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
  I all alone beweep my outcast state,
  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
  And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
  Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,
  Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
  With what I most enjoy contented least;
  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
  Haply I think on thee,-- and then my state,
  Like to the lark at break of day arising
  From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
    For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

  XXX

  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
  I summon up remembrance of things past,
  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
  And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
  Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
  For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
  And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
  And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
  And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
  Which I new pay as if not paid before.
    But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
    All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.

  XXXI

  Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
  Which I by lacking have supposed dead;
  And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,
  And all those friends which I thought buried.
  How many a holy and obsequious tear
  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
  As interest of the dead, which now appear
  But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!
  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
  That due of many now is thine alone:
    Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,
    And thou--all they--hast all the all of me.

  XXXII

  If thou survive my well-contented day,
  When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
  Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
  And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Exceeded by the height of happier men.
  O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
  'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
  A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
  To march in ranks of better equipage:
    But since he died and poets better prove,
    Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.

  XXXIII

  Full many a glorious morning have I seen
  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
  Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
  With ugly rack on his celestial face,
  And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
  With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
  But out! alack! he was but one hour mine,
  The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
    Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
    Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.

  XXXIV

  Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
  And make me travel forth without my cloak,
  To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
  Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
  'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
  For no man well of such a salve can speak,
  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
  The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
    Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
    And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.

  XXXV

  No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:
  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
  All men make faults, and even I in this,
  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
  Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,--
  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,--
  And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
  Such civil war is in my love and hate,
    That I an accessary needs must be,
    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.

  XXXVI

  Let me confess that we two must be twain,
  Although our undivided loves are one:
  So shall those blots that do with me remain,
  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
  In our two loves there is but one respect,
  Though in our lives a separable spite,
  Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

  XXXVII

  As a decrepit father takes delight
  To see his active child do deeds of youth,
  So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,
  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;
  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
  Or any of these all, or all, or more,
  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
  I make my love engrafted, to this store:
  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,
  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
  That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,
  And by a part of all thy glory live.
    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:
    This wish I have; then ten times happy me!

  XXXVIII

  How can my muse want subject to invent,
  While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
  O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me
  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
  For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
  When thou thy self dost give invention light?
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
    If my slight muse do please these curious days,
    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.

  XXXIX

  O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,
  When thou art all the better part of me?
  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
  And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
  Even for this, let us divided live,
  And our dear love lose name of single one,
  That by this separation I may give
  That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.
  O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,
  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
    By praising him here who doth hence remain.

  XL

  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;
  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
  All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.
  Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,
  I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;
  But yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest
  By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
  I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
  Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
  And yet, love knows it is a greater grief
  To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.
    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
    Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.

  XLI

  Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
  Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
  For still temptation follows where thou art.
  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd;
  And when a woman woos, what woman's son
  Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd?
  Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
  And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,
  Who lead thee in their riot even there
  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:--
    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
    Thine by thy beauty being false to me.

  XLII

  That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
  And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
  That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
  Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:
  Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;
  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
  Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
  If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
  And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
    But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
    Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.

  XLIII

  When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,
  For all the day they view things unrespected;
  But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
  And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
  Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
  How would thy shadow's form form happy show
  To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
  When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
  How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
  By looking on thee in the living day,
  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
    All days are nights to see till I see thee,
    And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.

  XLIV

  If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
  Injurious distance should not stop my way;
  For then despite of space I would be brought,
  From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.
  No matter then although my foot did stand
  Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee;
  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
  As soon as think the place where he would be.
  But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,
  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
  But that so much of earth and water wrought,
  I must attend time's leisure with my moan;
    Receiving nought by elements so slow
    But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.

  XLV

  The other two, slight air, and purging fire
  Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
  The first my thought, the other my desire,
  These present-absent with swift motion slide.
  For when these quicker elements are gone
  In tender embassy of love to thee,
  My life, being made of four, with two alone
  Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;
  Until life's composition be recur'd
  By those swift messengers return'd from thee,
  Who even but now come back again, assur'd,
  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:
    This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
    I send them back again, and straight grow sad.

  XLVI

  Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
  How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
  Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
  My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
  My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,--
  A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes--
  But the defendant doth that plea deny,
  And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
  To side this title is impannelled
  A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;
  And by their verdict is determined
  The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:
    As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,
    And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.

  XLVII

  Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
  And each doth good turns now unto the other:
  When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,
  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,
  With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
  And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
  Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
  So, either by thy picture or my love,
  Thy self away, art present still with me;
  For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
  And I am still with them, and they with thee;
    Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
    Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.

  XLVIII

  How careful was I when I took my way,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  That to my use it might unused stay
  From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
  But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
  Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
  Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
  Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
  Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,
  Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
  Within the gentle closure of my breast,
  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;
    And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
    For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.

  XLIX

  Against that time, if ever that time come,
  When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
  Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects;
  Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
  And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,
  When love, converted from the thing it was,
  Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
  Against that time do I ensconce me here,
  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
  And this my hand, against my self uprear,
  To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:
    To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
    Since why to love I can allege no cause.

  L

  How heavy do I journey on the way,
  When what I seek, my weary travel's end,
  Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,
  'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'
  The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
  Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
  As if by some instinct the wretch did know
  His rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:
  The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
  That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
  Which heavily he answers with a groan,
  More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
    For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
    My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.

  LI

  Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
  Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
  From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
  Till I return, of posting is no need.
  O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,
  When swift extremity can seem but slow?
  Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,
  In winged speed no motion shall I know,
  Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
  Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,
  Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;
  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,--
    'Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,
    Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.'

  LII

  So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,
  Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
  The which he will not every hour survey,
  For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
  Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
  Since, seldom coming in that long year set,
  Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
  Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
  So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
  Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
  To make some special instant special-blest,
  By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.
    Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
    Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.

  LIII

  What is your substance, whereof are you made,
  That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
  Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
  And you but one, can every shadow lend.
  Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
  Is poorly imitated after you;
  On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
  And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
  Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
  The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
  The other as your bounty doth appear;
  And you in every blessed shape we know.
    In all external grace you have some part,
    But you like none, none you, for constant heart.

  LIV

  O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.
  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
  For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.
  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
  As the perfumed tincture of the roses.
  Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly
  When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
  But, for their virtue only is their show,
  They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;
  Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
  Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:
    And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
    When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.

  LV

  Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
  Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
  But you shall shine more bright in these contents
  Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.
  When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
  And broils root out the work of masonry,
  Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn
  The living record of your memory.
  'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
  Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
  Even in the eyes of all posterity
  That wear this world out to the ending doom.
    So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
    You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.

  LVI

  Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
  Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
  Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,
  To-morrow sharpened in his former might:
  So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill
  Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
  To-morrow see again, and do not kill
  The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.
  Let this sad interim like the ocean be
  Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
  Come daily to the banks, that when they see
  Return of love, more blest may be the view;
    Or call it winter, which being full of care,
    Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.

  LVII

  Being your slave what should I do but tend,
  Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
  I have no precious time at all to spend;
  Nor services to do, till you require.
  Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
  Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
  Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
  When you have bid your servant once adieu;
  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
  Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
  But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
  Save, where you are, how happy you make those.
    So true a fool is love, that in your will,
    Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.

  LVIII

  That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
  I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
  Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
  Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
  O! let me suffer, being at your beck,
  The imprison'd absence of your liberty;
  And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,
  Without accusing you of injury.
  Be where you list, your charter is so strong
  That you yourself may privilage your time
  To what you will; to you it doth belong
  Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
    I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
    Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.

  LIX

  If there be nothing new, but that which is
  Hath been before, how are our brains beguil'd,
  Which labouring for invention bear amiss
  The second burthen of a former child!
  O! that record could with a backward look,
  Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
  Show me your image in some antique book,
  Since mind at first in character was done!
  That I might see what the old world could say
  To this composed wonder of your frame;
  Wh'r we are mended, or wh'r better they,
  Or whether revolution be the same.
    O! sure I am the wits of former days,
    To subjects worse have given admiring praise.

  LX

  Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
  So do our minutes hasten to their end;
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
  Nativity, once in the main of light,
  Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
  Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
  And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
  Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
  And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
  Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
  And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:
    And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand.
    Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.

  LXI

  Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
  My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
  Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
  While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
  Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
  So far from home into my deeds to pry,
  To find out shames and idle hours in me,
  The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
  O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
  It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:
  Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
  To play the watchman ever for thy sake:
    For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
    From me far off, with others all too near.

  LXII

  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
  And all my soul, and all my every part;
  And for this sin there is no remedy,
  It is so grounded inward in my heart.
  Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
  No shape so true, no truth of such account;
  And for myself mine own worth do define,
  As I all other in all worths surmount.
  But when my glass shows me myself indeed
  Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,
  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
  Self so self-loving were iniquity.
    'Tis thee,--myself,--that for myself I praise,
    Painting my age with beauty of thy days.

  LXIII

  Against my love shall be as I am now,
  With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;
  When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
  With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
  Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;
  And all those beauties whereof now he's king
  Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
  Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
  For such a time do I now fortify
  Against confounding age's cruel knife,
  That he shall never cut from memory
  My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
    His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
    And they shall live, and he in them still green.

  LXIV

  When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
  The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;
  When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd,
  And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
  When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
  Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
  And the firm soil win of the watery main,
  Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;
  When I have seen such interchange of state,
  Or state itself confounded, to decay;
  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--
  That Time will come and take my love away.
    This thought is as a death which cannot choose
    But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.

  LXV

  Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
  But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
  How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
  Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
  O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
  Against the wrackful siege of battering days,
  When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
  Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?
  O fearful meditation! where, alack,
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
    O! none, unless this miracle have might,
    That in black ink my love may still shine bright.

  LXVI

  Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
  As to behold desert a beggar born,
  And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
  And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
  And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,
  And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
  And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,
  And strength by limping sway disabled
  And art made tongue-tied by authority,
  And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill,
  And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
  And captive good attending captain ill:
    Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,
    Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.

  LXVII

  Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
  And with his presence grace impiety,
  That sin by him advantage should achieve,
  And lace itself with his society?
  Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
  And steel dead seeming of his living hue?
  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
  Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  And proud of many, lives upon his gains.
    O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had
    In days long since, before these last so bad.

  LXVIII

  Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
  When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
  Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
  Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
  Before the golden tresses of the dead,
  The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
  To live a second life on second head;
  Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
  In him those holy antique hours are seen,
  Without all ornament, itself and true,
  Making no summer of another's green,
  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
    And him as for a map doth Nature store,
    To show false Art what beauty was of yore.

  LXIX

  Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
  Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
  All tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due,
  Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
  Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;
  But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,
  In other accents do this praise confound
  By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
  They look into the beauty of thy mind,
  And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;
  Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
  To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
    But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
    The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.

  LXX

  That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,
  For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
  The ornament of beauty is suspect,
  A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
  So thou be good, slander doth but approve
  Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;
  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
  And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
  Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,
    If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.

  LXXI

  No longer mourn for me when I am dead
  Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
  Give warning to the world that I am fled
  From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
  Nay, if you read this line, remember not
  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
  That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
  If thinking on me then should make you woe.
  O! if,--I say you look upon this verse,
  When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
  But let your love even with my life decay;
    Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
    And mock you with me after I am gone.

  LXXII

  O! lest the world should task you to recite
  What merit lived in me, that you should love
  After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,
  For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
  Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
  To do more for me than mine own desert,
  And hang more praise upon deceased I
  Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
  O! lest your true love may seem false in this
  That you for love speak well of me untrue,
  My name be buried where my body is,
  And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
    For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
    And so should you, to love things nothing worth.

  LXXIII

  That time of year thou mayst in me behold
  When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
  Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
  In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
  As after sunset fadeth in the west;
  Which by and by black night doth take away,
  Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
  In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,
  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
  As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
  Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.
    This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.

  LXXIV

  But be contented: when that fell arrest
  Without all bail shall carry me away,
  My life hath in this line some interest,
  Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
  The very part was consecrate to thee:
  The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
  My spirit is thine, the better part of me:
  So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
  The prey of worms, my body being dead;
  The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
  Too base of thee to be remembered.
    The worth of that is that which it contains,
    And that is this, and this with thee remains.

  LXXV

  So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
  Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;
  And for the peace of you I hold such strife
  As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
  Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
  Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
  Now counting best to be with you alone,
  Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:
  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
  And by and by clean starved for a look;
  Possessing or pursuing no delight,
  Save what is had, or must from you be took.
    Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
    Or gluttoning on all, or all away.

  LXXVI

  Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
  So far from variation or quick change?
  Why with the time do I not glance aside
  To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
  Why write I still all one, ever the same,
  And keep invention in a noted weed,
  That every word doth almost tell my name,
  Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
  O! know sweet love I always write of you,
  And you and love are still my argument;
  So all my best is dressing old words new,
  Spending again what is already spent:
    For as the sun is daily new and old,
    So is my love still telling what is told.

  LXXVII

  Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
  Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
  These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
  And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
  The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
  Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
  Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
  Time's thievish progress to eternity.
  Look! what thy memory cannot contain,
  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
  Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
  To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
    These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
    Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.

  LXXVIII

  So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,
  And found such fair assistance in my verse
  As every alien pen hath got my use
  And under thee their poesy disperse.
  Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing
  And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
  Have added feathers to the learned's wing
  And given grace a double majesty.
  Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
  Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:
  In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
  And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;
    But thou art all my art, and dost advance
    As high as learning, my rude ignorance.

  LXXIX

  Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
  My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;
  But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,
  And my sick Muse doth give an other place.
  I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
  Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;
  Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
  He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.
  He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
  From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,
  And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
  No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
    Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
    Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.

  LXXX

  O! how I faint when I of you do write,
  Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
  And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
  To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!
  But since your worth--wide as the ocean is,--
  The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
  My saucy bark, inferior far to his,
  On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
  Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
  Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
  Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat,
  He of tall building, and of goodly pride:
    Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
    The worst was this,--my love was my decay.

  LXXXI

  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
  Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;
  From hence your memory death cannot take,
  Although in me each part will be forgotten.
  Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
  Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:
  The earth can yield me but a common grave,
  When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
  Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
  Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;
  And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
  When all the breathers of this world are dead;
    You still shall live,--such virtue hath my pen,--
    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.

  LXXXII

  I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,
  And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
  The dedicated words which writers use
  Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
  Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
  Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;
  And therefore art enforced to seek anew
  Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
  And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,
  What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
  Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd
  In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;
    And their gross painting might be better us'd
    Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd.

  LXXXIII

  I never saw that you did painting need,
  And therefore to your fair no painting set;
  I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
  That barren tender of a poet's debt:
  And therefore have I slept in your report,
  That you yourself, being extant, well might show
  How far a modern quill doth come too short,
  Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
  This silence for my sin you did impute,
  Which shall be most my glory being dumb;
  For I impair not beauty being mute,
  When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
    There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
    Than both your poets can in praise devise.

  LXXXIV

  Who is it that says most, which can say more,
  Than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?
  In whose confine immured is the store
  Which should example where your equal grew.
  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
  That to his subject lends not some small glory;
  But he that writes of you, if he can tell
  That you are you, so dignifies his story,
  Let him but copy what in you is writ,
  Not making worse what nature made so clear,
  And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
  Making his style admired every where.
    You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
    Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.

  LXXXV

  My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
  While comments of your praise richly compil'd,
  Reserve their character with golden quill,
  And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.
  I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
  And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'
  To every hymn that able spirit affords,
  In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
  Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'
  And to the most of praise add something more;
  But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
  Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
    Then others, for the breath of words respect,
    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.

  LXXXVI

  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
  Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
  As victors of my silence cannot boast;
  I was not sick of any fear from thence:
    But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
    Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.

  LXXXVII

  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
  And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
  The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
  My bonds in thee are all determinate.
  For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
  And for that riches where is my deserving?
  The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
  And so my patent back again is swerving.
  Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
  Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
  So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
  Comes home again, on better judgement making.
    Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.

  LXXXVIII

  When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,
  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
  With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,
  Upon thy part I can set down a story
  Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted;
  That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
  And I by this will be a gainer too;
  For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
  The injuries that to myself I do,
  Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
    That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.

  LXXXIX

  Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
  And I will comment upon that offence:
  Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,
  Against thy reasons making no defence.
  Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,
  To set a form upon desired change,
  As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,
  I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;
  Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue
  Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
  Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,
  And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
    For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
    For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.

  XC

  Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
  Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
  And do not drop in for an after-loss:
  Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,
  Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
  Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
  To linger out a purpos'd overthrow.
  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
  When other petty griefs have done their spite,
  But in the onset come: so shall I taste
  At first the very worst of fortune's might;
    And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
    Compar'd with loss of thee, will not seem so.

  XCI

  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
  Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
  Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;
  Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
  And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
  Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:
  But these particulars are not my measure,
  All these I better in one general best.
  Thy love is better than high birth to me,
  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
  Of more delight than hawks and horses be;
  And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:
    Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
    All this away, and me most wretchcd make.

  XCII

  But do thy worst to steal thyself away,
  For term of life thou art assured mine;
  And life no longer than thy love will stay,
  For it depends upon that love of thine.
  Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
  When in the least of them my life hath end.
  I see a better state to me belongs
  Than that which on thy humour doth depend:
  Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
  Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
  O! what a happy title do I find,
  Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
    But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
    Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.

  XCIII

  So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
  Like a deceived husband; so love's face
  May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;
  Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:
  For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
  Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
  In many's looks, the false heart's history
  Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.
  But heaven in thy creation did decree
  That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
  Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
  Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
    How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
    If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!

  XCIV

  They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
  That do not do the thing they most do show,
  Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;
  They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
  And husband nature's riches from expense;
  They are the lords and owners of their faces,
  Others, but stewards of their excellence.
  The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
  Though to itself, it only live and die,
  But if that flower with base infection meet,
  The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
    For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
    Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.

  XCV

  How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
  Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,
  Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
  O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.
  That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
  Making lascivious comments on thy sport,
  Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;
  Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
  O! what a mansion have those vices got
  Which for their habitation chose out thee,
  Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
  And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!
    Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;
    The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge.

  XCVI

  Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
  Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
  Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:
  Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.
  As on the finger of a throned queen
  The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,
  So are those errors that in thee are seen
  To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.
  How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
  If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
  How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
    But do not so; I love thee in such sort,
    As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

  XCVII

  How like a winter hath my absence been
  From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
  What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
  What old December's bareness everywhere!
  And yet this time removed was summer's time;
  The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
  Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
  But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;
  For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
  And, thou away, the very birds are mute:
    Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
    That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.

  XCVIII

  From you have I been absent in the spring,
  When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,
  Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,
  That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
  Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
  Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
  Could make me any summer's story tell,
  Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
  Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
  They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
    Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,
    As with your shadow I with these did play.

  XCIX

  The forward violet thus did I chide:
  Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
  If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
  Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
  In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.
  The lily I condemned for thy hand,
  And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;
  The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
  One blushing shame, another white despair;
  A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,
  And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
  But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth
  A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
    More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
    But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.

  C

  Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,
  To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
  Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
  Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
  Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
  In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
  Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
  And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
  Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
  If Time have any wrinkle graven there;
  If any, be a satire to decay,
  And make time's spoils despised every where.
    Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
    So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.

  CI

  O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
  For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd?
  Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
  So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
  Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say,
  'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;
  Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
  But best is best, if never intermix'd'?
  Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
  Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee
  To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
  And to be prais'd of ages yet to be.
    Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
    To make him seem long hence as he shows now.

  CII

  My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
  I love not less, though less the show appear;
  That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,
  The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
  Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
  When I was wont to greet it with my lays;
  As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
  And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
  Not that the summer is less pleasant now
  Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
  But that wild music burthens every bough,
  And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
    Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
    Because I would not dull you with my song.

  CIII

  Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,
  That having such a scope to show her pride,
  The argument, all bare, is of more worth
  Than when it hath my added praise beside!
  O! blame me not, if I no more can write!
  Look in your glass, and there appears a face
  That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
  Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
  Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
  To mar the subject that before was well?
  For to no other pass my verses tend
  Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
    And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,
    Your own glass shows you when you look in it.

  CIV

  To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
  For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,
  Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,
  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
  Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,
  In process of the seasons have I seen,
  Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
  Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
  Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,
  Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;
  So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
  Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:
    For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:
    Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.

  CV

  Let not my love be call'd idolatry,
  Nor my beloved as an idol show,
  Since all alike my songs and praises be
  To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
  Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,
  One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
  'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my argument,
  'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words;
  And in this change is my invention spent,
  Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
    Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,
    Which three till now, never kept seat in one.

  CVI

  When in the chronicle of wasted time
  I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
  And beauty making beautiful old rime,
  In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
  Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
  I see their antique pen would have express'd
  Even such a beauty as you master now.
  So all their praises are but prophecies
  Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
  And for they looked but with divining eyes,
  They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
    For we, which now behold these present days,
    Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.

  CVII

  Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
  Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
  Can yet the lease of my true love control,
  Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
  The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,
  And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
  Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,
  And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
  Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
  My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
  Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,
  While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
    And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
    When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.

  CVIII

  What's in the brain, that ink may character,
  Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?
  What's new to speak, what now to register,
  That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
  Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
  I must each day say o'er the very same;
  Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
  Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
  So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
  Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
  But makes antiquity for aye his page;
    Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
    Where time and outward form would show it dead.

  CIX

  O! never say that I was false of heart,
  Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,
  As easy might I from my self depart
  As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
  That is my home of love: if I have rang'd,
  Like him that travels, I return again;
  Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd,
  So that myself bring water for my stain.
  Never believe though in my nature reign'd,
  All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
  That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
  To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
    For nothing this wide universe I call,
    Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.

  CX

  Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
  And made my self a motley to the view,
  Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
  Made old offences of affections new;
  Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth
  Askance and strangely; but, by all above,
  These blenches gave my heart another youth,
  And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.
  Now all is done, save what shall have no end:
  Mine appetite I never more will grind
  On newer proof, to try an older friend,
  A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.
    Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
    Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.

  CXI

  O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
  The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
  That did not better for my life provide
  Than public means which public manners breeds.
  Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
  And almost thence my nature is subdu'd
  To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
  Pity me, then, and wish I were renew'd;
  Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink,
  Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  Nor double penance, to correct correction.
    Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,
    Even that your pity is enough to cure me.

  CXII

  Your love and pity doth the impression fill,
  Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
  For what care I who calls me well or ill,
  So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
  You are my all-the-world, and I must strive
  To know my shames and praises from your tongue;
  None else to me, nor I to none alive,
  That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
  In so profound abysm I throw all care
  Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
  To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
  Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
    You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
    That all the world besides methinks are dead.

  CXIII

  Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
  And that which governs me to go about
  Doth part his function and is partly blind,
  Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
  For it no form delivers to the heart
  Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:
  Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;
  For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
  The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
  The mountain or the sea, the day or night:
  The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
    Incapable of more, replete with you,
    My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.

  CXIV

  Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
  Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
  Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
  And that your love taught it this alchemy,
  To make of monsters and things indigest
  Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
  Creating every bad a perfect best,
  As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
  O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
  And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
  Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
    If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin
    That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.

  CXV

  Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
  Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
  Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
  My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
  But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents
  Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
  Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
  Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
  Alas! why fearing of Time's tyranny,
  Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'
  When I was certain o'er incertainty,
  Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
    Love is a babe, then might I not say so,
    To give full growth to that which still doth grow?

  CXVI

  Let me not to the marriage of true minds
  Admit impediments. Love is not love
  Which alters when it alteration finds,
  Or bends with the remover to remove:
  O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
  It is the star to every wandering bark,
  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
  Within his bending sickle's compass come;
  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
  But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
    If this be error and upon me prov'd,
    I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.

  CXVII

  Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,
  Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
  Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
  Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
  That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
  And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right;
  That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
  Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
  Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
  And on just proof surmise, accumulate;
  Bring me within the level of your frown,
  But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
    Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
    The constancy and virtue of your love.

  CXVIII

  Like as, to make our appetite more keen,
  With eager compounds we our palate urge;
  As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
  We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;
  Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
  To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
  And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
  To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing.
  Thus policy in love, to anticipate
  The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd,
  And brought to medicine a healthful state
  Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd;
    But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
    Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.

  CXIX

  What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,
  Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
  Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
  Still losing when I saw myself to win!
  What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
  Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
  How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,
  In the distraction of this madding fever!
  O benefit of ill! now I find true
  That better is, by evil still made better;
  And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
  Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
    So I return rebuk'd to my content,
    And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.

  CXX

  That you were once unkind befriends me now,
  And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,
  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
  For if you were by my unkindness shaken,
  As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;
  And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
  To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.
  O! that our night of woe might have remember'd
  My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
  And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd
  The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
    But that your trespass now becomes a fee;
    Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.

  CXXI

  'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,
  When not to be receives reproach of being;
  And the just pleasure lost, which is so deem'd
  Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing:
  For why should others' false adulterate eyes
  Give salutation to my sportive blood?
  Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
  Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
  No, I am that I am, and they that level
  At my abuses reckon up their own:
  I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
  By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;
    Unless this general evil they maintain,
    All men are bad and in their badness reign.

  CXXII

  Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
  Full character'd with lasting memory,
  Which shall above that idle rank remain,
  Beyond all date; even to eternity:
  Or, at the least, so long as brain and heart
  Have faculty by nature to subsist;
  Till each to raz'd oblivion yield his part
  Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.
  That poor retention could not so much hold,
  Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
  Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
  To trust those tables that receive thee more:
    To keep an adjunct to remember thee
    Were to import forgetfulness in me.

  CXXIII

  No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
  Thy pyramids built up with newer might
  To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
  They are but dressings of a former sight.
  Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
  What thou dost foist upon us that is old;
  And rather make them born to our desire
  Than think that we before have heard them told.
  Thy registers and thee I both defy,
  Not wondering at the present nor the past,
  For thy records and what we see doth lie,
  Made more or less by thy continual haste.
    This I do vow and this shall ever be;
    I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.

  CXXIV

  If my dear love were but the child of state,
  It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,
  As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
  Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.
  No, it was builded far from accident;
  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
  It fears not policy, that heretic,
  Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,
  But all alone stands hugely politic,
  That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
    To this I witness call the fools of time,
    Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.

  CXXV

  Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
  With my extern the outward honouring,
  Or laid great bases for eternity,
  Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
  Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
  Lose all and more by paying too much rent
  For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
  Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
  No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,
  And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
  Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,
  But mutual render, only me for thee.
    Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul
    When most impeach'd, stands least in thy control.

  CXXVI

  O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
  Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his fickle hour;
  Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
  Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
  If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
  As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
  She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
  May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
  Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
  She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:
    Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
    And her quietus is to render thee.

  CXXVII

  In the old age black was not counted fair,
  Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
  But now is black beauty's successive heir,
  And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:
  For since each hand hath put on Nature's power,
  Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,
  Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
  But is profan'd, if not lives in disgrace.
  Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
  At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
  Sland'ring creation with a false esteem:
    Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
    That every tongue says beauty should look so.

  CXXVIII

  How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,
  Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
  With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
  The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
  Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
  To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
  Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
  At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
  To be so tickled, they would change their state
  And situation with those dancing chips,
  O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
  Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips.
    Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
    Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.

  CXXIX

  The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
  Is lust in action: and till action, lust
  Is perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
  Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;
  Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;
  Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,
  Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,
  On purpose laid to make the taker mad:
  Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
  Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme;
  A bliss in proof,-- and prov'd, a very woe;
  Before, a joy propos'd; behind a dream.
    All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

  CXXX

  My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
  Coral is far more red, than her lips red:
  If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
  If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
  I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
  But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
  And in some perfumes is there more delight
  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
  That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
  I grant I never saw a goddess go,--
  My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
    And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,
    As any she belied with false compare.

  CXXXI

  Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
  As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
  For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
  Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
  Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,
  Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
  To say they err I dare not be so bold,
  Although I swear it to myself alone.
  And to be sure that is not false I swear,
  A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
  One on another's neck, do witness bear
  Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
    In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
    And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.

  CXXXII

  Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
  Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
  Have put on black and loving mourners be,
  Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
  And truly not the morning sun of heaven
  Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
  Nor that full star that ushers in the even,
  Doth half that glory to the sober west,
  As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
  O! let it then as well beseem thy heart
  To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
  And suit thy pity like in every part.
    Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
    And all they foul that thy complexion lack.

  CXXXIII

  Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
  For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
  Is't not enough to torture me alone,
  But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
  Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
  And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
  Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;
  A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross'd:
  Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
  But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
  Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
  Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:
    And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
    Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.

  CXXXIV

  So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
  And I my self am mortgag'd to thy will,
  Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
  Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
  But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
  For thou art covetous, and he is kind;
  He learn'd but surety-like to write for me,
  Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
  The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
  Thou usurer, that putt'st forth all to use,
  And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
    Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:
    He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.

  CXXXV

  Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'
  And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus;
  More than enough am I that vex'd thee still,
  To thy sweet will making addition thus.
  Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
  Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
  Shall will in others seem right gracious,
  And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
  The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,
  And in abundance addeth to his store;
  So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'
  One will of mine, to make thy large will more.
    Let no unkind 'No' fair beseechers kill;
    Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'

  CXXXVI

  If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
  Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',
  And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;
  Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.
  'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
  Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
  In things of great receipt with ease we prove
  Among a number one is reckon'd none:
  Then in the number let me pass untold,
  Though in thy store's account I one must be;
  For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
  That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:
    Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
    And then thou lov'st me for my name is 'Will.'

  CXXXVII

  Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
  That they behold, and see not what they see?
  They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
  Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
  If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,
  Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
  Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
  Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
  Why should my heart think that a several plot,
  Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
  Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
  To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
    In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,
    And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.

  CXXXVIII

  When my love swears that she is made of truth,
  I do believe her though I know she lies,
  That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
  Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
  Although she knows my days are past the best,
  Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:
  On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
  But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
  And wherefore say not I that I am old?
  O! love's best habit is in seeming trust,
  And age in love, loves not to have years told:
    Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
    And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.

  CXXXIX

  O! call not me to justify the wrong
  That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
  Wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue:
  Use power with power, and slay me not by art,
  Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
  Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
  What need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy might
  Is more than my o'erpress'd defence can bide?
  Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
  Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
  And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
  That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
    Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
    Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.


  CXL

  Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
  My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;
  Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
  The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
  If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
  Though not to love, yet, love to tell me so;--
  As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
  No news but health from their physicians know;--
  For, if I should despair, I should grow mad,
  And in my madness might speak ill of thee;
  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
  Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
    That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
    Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.

  CXLI

  In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,
  For they in thee a thousand errors note;
  But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
  Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote.
  Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted;
  Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
  Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
  To any sensual feast with thee alone:
  But my five wits nor my five senses can
  Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
  Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
  Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:
    Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
    That she that makes me sin awards me pain.

  CXLII

  Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
  Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:
  O! but with mine compare thou thine own state,
  And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
  Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,
  That have profan'd their scarlet ornaments
  And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lov'st those
  Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
  Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,
  Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
    By self-example mayst thou be denied!

  CXLIII

  Lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch
  One of her feather'd creatures broke away,
  Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
  In pursuit of the thing she would have stay;
  Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
  Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
  To follow that which flies before her face,
  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
  So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
  Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;
  But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,
  And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind;
    So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'
    If thou turn back and my loud crying still.

  CXLIV

  Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
  Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
  The better angel is a man right fair,
  The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
  To win me soon to hell, my female evil,
  Tempteth my better angel from my side,
  And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
  Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
  And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,
  Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
  But being both from me, both to each friend,
  I guess one angel in another's hell:
    Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
    Till my bad angel fire my good one out.

  CXLV

  Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
  Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
  To me that languish'd for her sake:
  But when she saw my woeful state,
  Straight in her heart did mercy come,
  Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
  Was us'd in giving gentle doom;
  And taught it thus anew to greet;
  'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
  That followed it as gentle day,
  Doth follow night, who like a fiend
  From heaven to hell is flown away.
    'I hate', from hate away she threw,
    And sav'd my life, saying 'not you'.

  CXLVI

  Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
  My sinful earth these rebel powers array,
  Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
  Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
  Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
  Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
  Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?
  Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
  And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
  Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
  Within be fed, without be rich no more:
    So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
    And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.

  CXLVII

  My love is as a fever longing still,
  For that which longer nurseth the disease;
  Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
  The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
  My reason, the physician to my love,
  Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
  Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
  Desire is death, which physic did except.
  Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
  My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
  At random from the truth vainly express'd;
    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

  CXLVIII

  O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight;
  Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  If it be not, then love doth well denote
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
  How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,
  That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
  The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.
    O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
    Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.

  CXLIX

  Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,
  When I against myself with thee partake?
  Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
  Am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?
  Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
  On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
  Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?
  What merit do I in my self respect,
  That is so proud thy service to despise,
  When all my best doth worship thy defect,
  Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
    But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
    Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.

  CL

  O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,
  With insufficiency my heart to sway?
  To make me give the lie to my true sight,
  And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
  Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
  That in the very refuse of thy deeds
  There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
  That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
  Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
  The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
  O! though I love what others do abhor,
  With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
    If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me,
    More worthy I to be belov'd of thee.

  CLI

  Love is too young to know what conscience is,
  Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
  Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
  For, thou betraying me, I do betray
  My nobler part to my gross body's treason;
  My soul doth tell my body that he may
  Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,
  But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
  As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
  He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
  To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
    No want of conscience hold it that I call
    Her 'love,' for whose dear love I rise and fall.

  CLII

  In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
  But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
  In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,
  In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
  But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
  When I break twenty? I am perjur'd most;
  For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,
  And all my honest faith in thee is lost:
  For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
  Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;
  And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
  Or made them swear against the thing they see;
    For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I,
    To swear against the truth so foul a lie!

  CLIII

  Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:
  A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
  And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
  In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
  Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love,
  A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
  And grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove
  Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
  But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
  The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
  I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
  And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
    But found no cure, the bath for my help lies
    Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.

  CLIV

  The little Love-god lying once asleep,
  Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
  Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
  Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
  The fairest votary took up that fire
  Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
  And so the general of hot desire
  Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.
  This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
  Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
  Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
  For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,
    Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
    Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
