Thou aged unreluctant earth who dost
with quivering continual thighs invite
the thrilling rain the slender paramour
to toy with thy extraordinary lust,
(the sinuous rain which rising from thy bed
steals to his wife the sky and hour by hour
wholly renews her palefleshwith delight)
--immortally whence are the high gods fled?

Speak elm eloquent pandar with thy nod
significant to the ecstatic earth
in token of his coming whom her soul
burns to embrace--and didst thou know the god
from but the imprint of whose cloven feet
the shrieking dryad sought her leafy goal,
at the mere echo of whose shining mirth
the furious hearts of mountains ceased to beat?

Wind beautifully who wanderest
over smooth pages of forgotten joy
proving the peaceful theorems of the flowers
--didst e'er depart upon more exquisite quest?
and did thy fortunate fingers sometime dwell
(within a greener shadow of secret bowers)
among the curves of that delicious boy
whose serious grace one goddess loved too well?

Chryselephantine Zeus Olympian
sceptred colossus of the Pheidian soul
whose eagle frights creation,in whose palm
Nike presents the crown sweetest to man,
whose lilied robe the sun's white hands emboss,
betwixt whose absolute feet anoint with calm
of intent stars circling the acerb pole
poises,smiling,the diadumenos

     in whose young chiseled eyes the people saw
     their once again victorious Pantarkes
     (whose grace the prince of artists made him bold
     to imitate between the feet of awe),
     thunderer whose omnipotent brow showers
     its curls of unendured eternal gold
     over the infinite breast in bright degrees,
     whose pillow is the graces and the hours,

     father of gods and men whose subtle throne
     twain sphinxes bear each with a writhing youth
     caught to her brazen breasts,whose foot-stool tells
     how fought the looser of the warlike zone
     of her that brought forth tall Hippolytus,
     lord on whose pedestal the deep expels
     (over Selene's car closing uncouth)
     of Helios the sweet wheels tremulous--

     are there no kings in Argos,that the song
     is silent,of the steep unspeaking tower
     within whose brightening strictness Danae
     saw the night severed and the glowing throng
     descend,felt on her flesh the amorous strain
     of gradual hands and yielding to that fee
     her eager body's unimmortal flower
     knew in the darkness a more burning rain?


                             2.

     And still the mad magnificent herald Spring
     assembles beauty from forgetfulness
     with the wild trump of April:witchery
     of sound and odour drives the wingless thing
     man forth into bright air,for now the red
     leaps in the maple's cheek,and suddenly
     by shining hordes in sweet unserious dress
     ascends the golden crocus from the dead.

     On dappled dawn forth rides the pungent sun
     with hooded day preening upon his hand
     followed by gay untimidfinalflowers
     (which dressed in various tremulous armor stun
     the eyes of ragged earth who sees them pass)
     while hunted from his kingdom winter cowers,
     seeing green armies steadily expand
     hearing the spear-song of the marching grass.

                                                    5

A silver sudden parody of snow
tickles the air to golden tears,and hark!
the flicker's laughing yet,while on the hills
the pines deepen to whispers primeval and throw
backward their foreheads to the barbarous bright
sky,and suddenly from the valley thrills
the unimaginable upward lark
and drowns the earth and passes into light

(slowly in life's serene perpetual round
a pale world gathers comfort to her soul,
hope richly scattered by the abundant sun
invades the new mosaic of the ground
--let but the incurious curtaining dusk be drawn
surpassing nets are sedulously spun
to snare the brutal dew,--the authentic scroll
of fairie hands and vanishing with dawn).

Spring,that omits no mention of desire
in every curved and curling thing,yet holds
continuous intercourse--through skies and trees
the lilac's smoke the poppy's pompous fire
the pansy's purple patience and the grave
frailty of daises--by what rare unease
revealed of teasingly transparent folds--
with man's poor soul superlatively brave.

Surely from robes of particoloured peace
with mouth flower-faint and undiscovered eyes
and dim slow perfect body amorous
(whiter than lilies which are born and cease
for being whiter than this world)exhales
the hovering high perfume curious
of that one month for whom the whole year dies,
risen at length from palpitating veils.

O still miraculous MaylO shining girl
of time untarnished!0 small intimate
gently primeval hands,frivolous feet
divine.'O singular and breathless pearl!
O indefinable frail ultimate pose!
0 visible beatitude sweet sweet
intolerable.'silence immaculate
of god's evasive audible great rose!

                                 3-

     Lover,lead forth thy love unto that bed
     prepared by whitest hands of waiting years,
     curtained with wordless worship absolute,
     unto the certain altar at whose head
     stands that clear candle whose expecting breath
     exults upon the tongue offlamehalf-mute,
     (haste ere some thrush with silver several tears
     complete the perfumed paraphrase of death).

     Now is the time when all occasional things
     close into silence,only one tree,one
     svelte translation of eternity
     unto the pale meaning of heaven clings,
     (whose million leaves in winsome indolence
     simmer upon thinking twilight momently)
     as down the oblivious west's numerous dun
     magnificence conquers magnificence.

     In heaven's intolerable athanor
     inimitably tortured the base day
     utters at length her soft intrinsic hour,
     and from those tenuous fires which more and more
     sink and are lost the divine alchemist,
     the magus of creation,lifts a flower--
     whence is the world's insufferable clay
     clothed with incognizable amethyst.

     Lady at whose imperishable smile
     the amazed doves flicker upon sunny wings
     as if in terror of eternity,
     (or seeming that they would mistrust a while
     the moving of beauteous dead mouths throughout
     that very proud transparent company
     of quivering ghosts-of-love which scarcely sings
     drifting in slow diaphanous faint rout),

     queen in the inconceivable embrace
     of whose tremendous hair that blossom stands
     whereof is most desire,yet less than those
     twain perfect roses whose ambrosial grace,
     goddess,thy crippled thunder-forging groom
     or the loud lord of skipping maenads knows,--
     having Discordia's apple in thy hands,
     which the scared shepherd gave thee for his doom--

                                                     7

  0 thou within the chancel of whose charms
  the tall boy god of everlasting war
  received the shuddering sacrament of sleep,
  betwixt whose cool incorrigible arms
  impaled upon delicious mystery,
  with gaunt limbs reeking of the whispered deep,
  deliberate groping ocean fondled o'er
  the warm longflowerof unchastity,

  imperial Cytherea,from frail foam
  sprung with irrevocable nakedness
  to strike the young world into smoking song--
  as the first star perfects the sensual dome
  of darkness,and the sweet strong final bird
  transcends the sight,0 thou to whom belong
  the hearts of lovers!--I beseech thee bless
  thy suppliant singer and his wandering word.

                     OF NICOLETTE

     dreaming in marble all the castle lay
     like some gigantic ghost-flower born of night
     blossoming in white towers to the moon,
     soft sighed the passionate darkness to the tune
     of tiny troubadours,and(phantom-white)
     dumb-blooming boughs let fall their glorious snows,
     and the unearthly sweetness of a rose
     swam upward from the troubled heart of May;

     a Winged Passion woke and one by one
     there fell upon the night,like angel's tears,
     the syllables of that mysterious prayer,
     and as an opening lily drowsy-fair
     (when from her couch of poppy petals peers
     the sleepy morning)gently draws apart
     her curtains,and lays bare her trembling heart,
     with beads of dew made jewels by the sun,

     so one high shining tower(which as a glass
     turned light toflameand blazed with snowy fire)
     unfolding,gave the moon a nymphlike face,
     a form whose snowy symmetry of grace
     haunted the limbs as music haunts the lyre,
     a creature of white hands,who letting fall
     a thread of lustre from the castle wall
     glided,a drop of radiance,to the grass--

     shunning the sudden moonbeam's treacherous snare
     she sought the harbouring dark,and(catching up
     her delicate silk)all white,with shining feet,
     went forth into the dew:right wildly beat
     her heart at every kiss of daisy-cup,
     and from her cheek the beauteous colour went
     with every bough that reverently bent
     to touch the yellow wonder of her hair.

let not thy lust one threaded moment lose:

free upon terrific pastures pale,


whose tall mysterious shepherd lifts a cheek
teartroubled to the momentary wind
with guiding smile,lips wisely minced for blown
kisses,condemnatory fingers thinned
of pity--so he stands counting the moved
myriads wonderfully loved,
(hasten,it is the moment which shall seek
all blossoms that do learn,scents of not known

cadence of our greyfleshin the gloom!

but a rain frailly raging whom the hills
sink into and their sunsets,it shall pass.
Our feet tread sleepless meadows sweet with fear")


then be with me:unseriously seem
by the perusing greenness of thy thought
my golden soul fabulously to glue
in a superior terror;be thy taut
flesh silver,like the currency of faint
cities eternal--ere the sinless taint

shall my love wholly taste thee as a new
wine from steep hills by darkness softly brought--

(be with me in the sacred witchery
of almostness which May makes follow soon
on the sweet heels of passed afterday,
clothe thy soul's coming merely,with a croon
of mingling robes musically revealed
in rareness:let thy twain eyes deeply wield
a noise of petals falling silently
through the far-spaced possible nearaway
from huge trees drenched by a rounding moon)

when life is quite through with
and leaves say alas,
much is to do
for the swallow,that closes
a flight in the blue;

when love's had his tears out,
perhaps shall pass
a million years

on the poppies,the dears;

when all's done and said,and
under the grass
lies her head
by oaks and roses
deliberated.)

      Always before your voice my soul
      half-beautiful and wholly droll
      is as some smooth and awkward foal,
      whereof young moons begin
      the newness of his skin,

      so of my stupid sincere youth
      the exquisite failure uncouth
      discovers a trembling and smooth
      Unstrength,against the strong
      silences of your song;

      or as a single lamb whose sheen
      of full unsheared fleece is mean
      beside its lovelier friends,between
      your thoughts more white than wool
      My thought is sorrowful:

      but my heart smote in trembling thirds
      of anguish quivers to your words,
      As to aflightof thirty birds
      shakes with a thickening fright
      the sudden fooled light.

      it is the autumn of a year:
      When through the thin air stooped with fear,
      across the harvest whitely peer
      empty of surprise
      death's faultless eyes

      (whose hand my folded soul shall know
      while on faint hills do frailly go
      The peaceful terrors of the snow,
      and before your dead face
      which sleeps,a dream shall pass)

      and these my days their sounds and flowers
      Fall in a pride of petaled hours,
      likeflowersat the feet of mowers
      whose bodies strong with love
      through meadows hugely move.

yet what am i that such and such
mysteries very simply touch
me,whose heart-wholeness overmuch
Expects of your hair pale,
a terror musical?

while in an earthless hour my fond
soul seriously yearns beyond
this fern of sunset frond on frond
opening in a rare
Slowness of gloried air...

The flute of morning stilled in noon--
noon the implacable bassoon--
now Twilight seeks the thrill of moon,
washed with a wild and thin
despair of violin

Thy fingers make early flowers of
all things.
thy hair mostly the hours love:
a smoothness which
sings,saying
(though love be a day)
do not fear,we will go amaying.

thy whitest feet crisply are straying.
Always
thy moist eyes are at kisses playing,
whose strangeness much
says;singing
(though love be a day)
for which girl art thou flowers bringing?

To be thy lips is a sweet thing
and small.
Death,Thee i call rich beyond wishing
if this thou catch,
else missing.
(though love be a day
and life be nothing,it shall not stop kissing).

All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
the merry deer ran before.

Fleeter be they than dappled dreams
the swift sweet deer
the red rare deer.

Four red roebuck at a white water
the cruel bugle sang before.

Horn at hip went my love riding
riding the echo down
into the silver dawn.

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
the level meadows ran before.

Softer be they than slippered sleep
the lean lithe deer
the fleet flown deer.

Four fleet does at a gold valley
the famished arrow sang before.

Bow at belt went my love riding
riding the mountain down
into the silver dawn.

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
the sheer peaks ran before.

Paler be they than daunting death
the sleek slim deer
the tall tense deer.

Four tall stags at a green mountain
the lucky hunter sang before.

All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
my heart fell dead before.

Between my lips which did sing

Into strenuous birds shall go

their wings will touch with her face

                    PUELLA MEA

      Harun Omar and Master Hafiz
      keep your dead beautiful ladies.
      Mine is a little lovelier
      than any of your ladies were.

      In her perfectest array
      my lady,moving in the day,
      is a little stranger thing
      than crisp Sheba with her king
      in the morning wandering.
         Through the young and awkward hours
      my lady perfectly moving,
      through the new world scarce astir
      my fragile lady wandering
      in whose perishable poise
      is the mystery of Spring
      (with her beauty more than snow
      dexterous and fugitive
      my very frail lady drifting
      distinctly,moving like a myth
      in the uncertain morning,with
      April feet like sudden flowers
      and all her body filled with May)
      --moving in the unskilful day
      my lady utterly alive,
      to me is a more curious thing
      (a thing more nimble and complete)
      than ever to Judea's king
      were the shapely sharp cunning
      and withal delirious feet
      of the Princess Salome
      carefully dancing in the noise
      of Herod's silence,long ago.


      If she a little turn her head
      i know that i am wholly dead:
      nor ever did on such a throat
      the lips of Tristram slowly dote,
      La beale Isoud whose leman was.
      And if my lady look at me
      (with her eyes which like two elves
      incredibly amuse themselves)
      with a look of faerie,

                                             21

perhaps a little suddenly
(as sometimes the improbable
beauty of my lady will)
--at her glance my spirit shies
rearing(as in the miracle
of a lady who had eyes
which the king's horses might not kill.)
   But should my lady smile,it were
aflowerof so pure surprise
(it were so very new a flower,
aflowerso frail,a flower so glad)
as trembling used to yield with dew
when the world was young and new
(aflowersuch as the world had
in Springtime when the world was mad
and Launcelot spoke to Guenever,
aflowerwhich most heavy hung
with silence when the world was young
and Diarmuid looked in Grania's eyes.)
   But should my lady's beauty play
at not speaking(sometimes as
it will)the silence of her face
doth immediately make
in my heart so great a noise,
as in the sharp and thirsty blood
of Paris would not all the Troys
of Helen's beauty:never did
Lord Jason(in impossible things
victorious impossibly)
so wholly burn,to undertake
Medea's rescuing eyes;nor he
when swooned the white egyptian day
who with Egypt's body lay.


Lovely as those ladies were
mine is a little lovelier.

And if she speaks in her frail way,
it is wholly to bewitch
my smallest thought with a most swift
radiance wherein slowly drift
murmurous things divinely bright;
it is foolingly to smite
my spirit with the lithe free twitch
of scintillant space,with the cool writhe

of gloom truly which syncopate
some sunbeam's skilful fingerings;
it is utterly to lull
with foliate inscrutable
sweetness my soul obedient;
it is to stroke my being with
numbing forests frolicsome,
fleetly mystical,aroam
with keen creatures of idiom
(beings alert and innocent
very deftly upon which
indolent miracles impinge)
--it is distinctly to confute
my reason with the deep caress
of every most shy thing and mute,
it is to quell me with the twinge
of all living intense things.
   Never my soul so fortunate
is(past the luck of all dead men
and loving)as invisibly when
upon her palpable solitude
a furtive occult fragrance steals,
a gesture of immaculate
perfume--whereby(with fear aglow)
my soul is wont wholly to know
the poignant instantaneous fern
whose scrupulous enchanted fronds
toward all things intrinsic yearn,
the immanent subliminal
fern of her delicious voice
(of her voice which always dwells
beside the vivid magical
impetuous and utter ponds
of dream;and very secret food
its leaves inimitable find
beyond the white authentic springs,
beyond the sweet instinctive wells,
which make toflourishthe minute
spontaneous meadow of her mind)
--the vocal fern,always which feels
the keen ecstatic actual tread
(and thereto perfectly responds)
of all things exquisite and dead,
all living things and beautiful.

(Caliph and king their ladies had
to love them and to make them glad,
when the world was young and mad,
in the city of Bagdad--
mine is a little lovelier
than any of those ladies were.)

Her body is most beauteous,
being for all things amorous
fashioned very curiously
of roses and of ivory.
The immaculate crisp head
is such as only certain dead
and careful painters love to use
for their youngest angels(whose
praising bodies in a row
between slow gloriesfleetlygo.)
Upon a keen and lovely throat
the strangeness of her face doth float,
which in eyes and lips consists
--always upon the mouth there trysts
curvingly a fragile smile
which like aflowerlieth(while
within the eyes is dimly heard
a wistful and precarious bird.)
Springing from fragrant shoulders small,
ardent,and perfectly withal
smooth to stroke and sweet to see
as a supple and young tree,
her slim lascivious arms alight
in skilful wrists which hint at flight
--my lady's very singular
and slenderest hands moreover are
(which as lilies smile and quail)
of all things perfect the most frail.

(Whoso rideth in the tale
of Chaucer knoweth many a pair
of companions blithe and fair;
who to walk with Master Gower
in Confessio doth prefer
shall not lack for beauty there,
nor he that will amaying go
with my lord Boccaccio--
whoso knocketh at the door

24

      of Marie and of Maleore
      findeth of ladies goodly store
      whose beauty did in nothing err.
      If to me there shall appear
      than a rose more sweetly known,
      more silently than a flower,
      my lady naked in her hair--
      i for those ladies nothing care
      nor any lady dead and gone.)

      Each tapering breast is firm and smooth
      that in a lovely fashion doth
      from my lady's body grow;
      as morning may a lily know,
      her petaled flesh doth entertain
      the adroit blood's mysterious skein
      (but like some passionate earlier
      flower,the snow will oft utter,
      whereof the year has perfect bliss--
      for each breast a blossom is,
      which being a little while caressed
      its fragrance makes the lover blest.)
      Her waist is a most tiny hinge
      offlesh,awinsome thing and strange;
      apt in my hand warmly to lie
      it is a throbbing neck whereby
      to grasp the belly's ample vase
      (that urgent urn which doth amass
      for whoso drinks,a dizzier wine
      than should the grapes of heaven combine
      with earth's madness)--'tis a gate
      unto a palace intricate
      (whereof the luscious pillars rise
      which are her large and shapely thighs)
      in whose dome the trembling bliss
      of a kingdom wholly is.
         Beneath her thighs such legs are seen
      as were the pride of the world's queen:
      each is a verb,miraculous
      inflected oral devious,
      beneath the body's breathing noun
      (moreover the delicious frown
      of the grave great sensual knees

as if for fear you would espy
the little distinct foot(if whose
very minuteness doth abuse
reason,why then the artificer
did most exquisitely err.)

When the world was like a song
heard behind a golden door,
poet and sage and caliph had
to love them and to make them glad
ladies with lithe eyes and long
(when the world was like a flower
Omar Hafiz and Harun
loved their ladies in the moon)
--fashioned very curiously
of roses and of ivory
if naked she appears to me
myfleshis an enchanted tree;
with her lips' most frail parting
my body hears the cry of Spring,
and with their frailest syllable
its leaves go crisp with miracle.


Love!--maker of my lady,
in that always beyond this
poem or any poem she
of whose body words are afraid
perfectly beautiful is,
forgive these words which i have made.
And never boast your dead beauties,
you greatest lovers in the world!
who with Grania strangely fled,
who with Egypt went to bed,
whom white-thighed Semiramis
put up her mouth to wholly kiss--
never boast your dead beauties,
mine being unto me sweeter
(of whose shy delicious glance
things which never more shall be,
perfect things of faerie,
are intense inhabitants;
in whose warm superlative
body do distinctly live
all sweet cities passed away--
in herfleshat break of day

      are the smells of Nineveh,
      in her eyes when day is gone
      are the cries of Babylon.)
      Diarmuid Paris and Solomon,
      Omar Harun and Master Hafiz,
      to me your ladies are all one--
      keep your dead beautiful ladies.

      Eater of all things lovely--Time!
      upon whose watering lips the world
      poises a moment(futile,proud,
      a costly morsel of sweet tears)
      gesticulates,and disappears--
      of all dainties which do crowd
      gaily upon oblivion
      sweeter than any there is one;
      to touch it is the fear of rhyme--
      in life's very fragile hour
      (when the world was like a tale
      made of laughter and of dew,
      was aflight,aflower,a flame,
      was a tendrilfleetlycurled
      upon frailness)used to stroll
      (very slowly)one or two
      ladies likeflowersmade,
      softly used to wholly move
      slender ladies made of dream
      (in the lazy world and new
      sweetly used to laugh and love
      ladies with crisp eyes and frail,
      in the city of Bagdad.)


      Keep your dead beautiful ladies
      Harun Omar and Master Hafiz.

you are so little
you are more like a flower

who found you in the green forest
and were you very sorry to come away?
see       i will comfort you
because you smell so sweetly

i will kiss your cool bark
and hug you safe and tight
just as your mother would,
only don't be afraid

look       the spangles
that sleep all the year in a dark box
dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine,
the balls the chains red and gold thefluffythreads,

put up your little arms
and i'll give them all to you to hold
every finger shall have its ring
and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy

then when you're quite dressed
you'll stand in the window for everyone to see
and how they'll stare!
oh but you'll be very proud

and my little sister and i will take hands
and looking up at our beautiful tree
we'll dance and sing

my love
thy hair is one kingdom
  the king whereof is darkness
thy forehead is a flight of flowers

thy head is a quick forest
  filled with sleeping birds
thy breasts are swarms of white bees
  upon the bough of thy body
thy body to me is April
in whose armpits is the approach of spring

thy thighs are white horses yoked to a chariot
   of kings
they are the striking of a good minstrel
between them is always a pleasant song

my love
thy head is a casket
   of the cool jewel of thy mind
the hair of thy head is one warrior
   innocent of defeat
thy hair upon thy shoulders is an army
   with victory and with trumpets

thy legs are the trees of dreaming
whose fruit is the very eatage of forgetfulness

thy lips are satraps in scarlet
   in whose kiss is the combining of kings
thy wrists
 are holy
   which are the keepers of the keys of thy blood
thy feet upon thy ankles areflowersin vases
   of silver

 in thy beauty is the dilemma of flutes

   thy eyes are the betrayal
 of bells comprehended through incense

   desire to thwart me and became

   singing and i came
   riding upon a scarlet sunset
   trampling the night       easily
   from the shocked impossible
   tower i caught
   you strained you
   broke you upon my blood

   beloved i dreamed
   i thought you would have deceived
   me and became a star in the kingdom
   of heaven
   through day and space i saw you close
   your eyes        and i came riding
   upon a thousand crimson years arched with agony
   i reined them in tottering before
   the throne and as
   they shied at the automaton moon from
   the transplendent hand of sombre god
   i picked you
as an apple is picked by the little peasants for their girls

the emperor
sleeps in a palace of porphyry
which was a million years building
he takes the air in a howdah
of jasper beneath saffron
umbrellas
upon an elephant
twelve feet high
behind whose ear
sits always a crowned
king twir-
ling an
ankus of
ebony
the fountains of the emperor's
palace run sunlight and
moonlight and the emperor's
elephant is a thousand years old

the harem of
the emperor
is carpeted with
gold cloth
from the
ceiling(one
diamond timid
with nesting incense)
fifty
marble
pillars
slipped from immeasurable
height,fall,fifty,silent

in the incense is tangled a cool moon

s

         there are thrice-three-hundred
         doors carven of chalcedony and
         before every door a naked
         eunuch watches
         on their heads turbans of a hundred
         colours
         in their hands scimitars like windy torches
         each
         is
         blacker than oblivion

         the ladies
         of the emperor's
         harem are queens
         of all the earth and the rings
         upon their hands are from mines
         a mile deep
         but the body of
         the queen of queens is
         more transparent
        than water,she is softer than birds



                               2.


     when the emperor is very
     amorous he reclines upon
     the couch of couches and
     beckons        with
     the little
     finger of his left
     hand
     then the
     thrice-three-hundredth
     door is opened by the tallest
     eunuch and the queen
     of queens comes
     forth
     ankles
     musical with large pearls
     kingdoms in her ears

the emperor a cithern-

the queen of queens is dancing

her subtle
body weaving

lust
her
stealing body ex-
 pending gathering pouring upon itself      stiffenS
 to a
white thorn
 of desire

 the taut neck of the citharede wags
 in the dust the ghastly warriors
 amber with lust breathe
 together      the emperor,exerting
 himself among his pillows throws
 jewels at the queen of queens and
 white money upon her nakedness
 he
 nods
            and all
 depart through the bruised air aflutter with pearls

i shall instruct

hours

        dead too,

ifi have made
a fragile certain

song under the window of your soul
it is not like any songs

they have been faithful

they were faithful
and which i despise,

admitting i have been true
only to the noise of worms,
in the eligible day
under the unaccountable sun)

my fragile certain song
that we may watch together

how behind the doomed
exact smile of life's
placid obscure palpable
carnival where to a normal

melody of probable violins dance
the square virtues and the oblong sins

gesticulate the accurate

strenuous lips of incorruptible
Nothing         under the ample
sun,under the insufficient
dav under the noise of worms

the bigness of cannon
is skilful,

but i have seen
death's clever enormous voice
which hides in a fragility
of poppies....

i say that sometimes
on these long talkative animals
are laid fists of huger silence.

I have seen all the silence
filled with vivid noiseless boys

at Roupy
i have seen
between barrages,

the night utter ripe unspeaking girls.

conversation with my friend is particularly

to enjoy the composed sudden body atop which always quiv-
ers the electric Distinct face haughtily vital clinched
in a swoon of synopsis

despite a sadistic modesty his mind is seen frequently
fingering the exact beads of a faultless languor when
invisibly consult with some delicious image the a little
strolling lips and eyes inwardly crisping

for my friend,feeling is the sacred and agonizing prox-
imity to its desire of a doomed impetuous acute sentience
whose whitehot lips however suddenly approached may never
quite taste the wine which their nearness evaporates

to think is the slippery contours of a vase inexpressibly
fragile it is for the brain irrevocably frigid to touch a
merest shape which however slenderly by it caressed will
explode and spill the immediate imperceptible content

my friend's being,out of the spontaneous clumsy trivial
acrobatic edgeless gesture of existence,continually whit-
tles keen careful futile flowers

(isolating with perpetually meticulous concupiscence the
bright large undeniable disease of Life,himself occasion-
ally contrives an unreal precise intrinsic fragment of
actuality),

feel that i cleverly am being altered that i slightly am becoming
something a little different,in fact

Hereupon helpless i utter lilac shreiks of scarlet bellowings.

my impatience to an edge--my girl's tall

in lowliness,noting the fatal flight

in the poised radiance of perpetualness.

great writhing words as,uttering overmuch,
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay;

Spring is like a perhaps hand
(which comes carefully
out of Nowhere)arranging
a window,into which people look(while
people stare
arranging and changing placing
carefully there a strange
thing and a known thing here)and

changing everything carefully

spring is like a perhaps
Hand in a window
(carefully to
and fro moving New and
Old things,while
people stare carefully
moving a perhaps
fraction offlowerhere placing
an inch of air there)and

without breaking anything.

gee i like to think of dead it means nearer because deeper firmer
since darker than little round water at one end of the well    it's
too cool to be crooked and it's too firm to be hard but it's sharp
and thick and it loves, every old thing falls in rosebugs and
jackknives and kittens and pennies they all sit there looking at
each other having the fastest time because they've never met before

dead's more even than how many ways of sitting on your head your
unnatural hair has in the morning

dead's clever too like POF goes the alarm off and the little striker
having the best time tickling away everybody's brain so everybody
just puts out their finger and they stuff the poor thing all full
of fingers

dead has a smile like the nicest man you've never met who maybe winks ,
at you in a streetcar and you pretend you don't but really you do
see and you are My how glad he winked and hope he'll do it again

or if it talks about you somewhere behind your back it makes your neck
feel pleasant and stoopid    and if dead says may i have this one and
was never introduced you say Yes because you know you want it to dance
with you and it wants to and it can dance and Whocares

dead's fine like hands do you see that water flowerpots in windows but
they live higher in their house than you so that's all you see but you
don't want to

dead's happy like the way underclothes All so differently solemn and
inti and sitting on one string

dead never says my dear,Time for your musiclesson and you like music and
to have somebody play who can but you know you never can and why have to?

dead's nice like a dance where you danced simple hours and you take all
your prickly-clothes off and squeeze-into-largeness without one word and
you lie still as anything in largeness and this largeness begins to give
you,the dance all over again and you,feel all again all over the way men
you liked made you feel when they touched you(but that's not all)because
largeness tells you so you can feel what you made,men feel when,you touched,
them

dead's sorry like a thistlefluff-thing which goes landing away all by
himself on somebody's roof or something where who-ever-heard-of-growing
and nobody expects you to anyway

                                    FOREWORD

On the assumption that my technique is either complicated or original or both,the
publishers have politely requested me to write an introduction to this book.
  At least my theory of technique,if I have one,is very far from original;nor is it
complicated.    I can express it infifteenwords,by quoting The Eternal Question And
Immortal Answer of burlesk,viz. "Would you hit a woman with a child?--No,I'd hit
her with a brick."  Like the burlesk comedian,I am abnormally fond of that precision
which creates movement.
  If a poet is anybody,he is somebody to whom things made matter very little--some-
body who is obsessed by Making. Like all obsessions,the Making obsession has
disadvantages;for instance,my only interest in making money would be to make it.
Fortunately,however,I should prefer to make almost anything else,including loco-
motives and roses. It is with roses and locomotives(not to mention acrobats Spring
electricity Coney Island the 4th of July the eyes of mice and Niagara Falls)that my
"poems" are competing.
  They are also competing with each other,with elephants,and with El Greco.
  Ineluctable preoccupation with The Verb gives a poet one priceless advantage:
whereas nonmakers must content themselves with the merely undeniable fact that two
times two is four,he rejoices in a purely irresistible truth(to be found,in abbreviated
costume,upon the title page of the present volume).
                                                                       E. E. CUMMINGS

  Will i ever forget that precarious moment?

  As i was standing on the third rail waiting for the next train to grind me
into lifeless atoms various absurd thoughts slyly crept into my highly sexed
mind.

  It seemed to me that i had first of all really made quite a mistake in being
at all born,seeing that i was wifeless and only half awake,cursed with pimples,
correctly dressed,cleanshaven above the nombril,and much to my astonishment much
impressed by having once noticed(as an infantile phenomenon)George Washington al-
most incompletely surrounded by well-drawn icecakes beheld being too strong,in
brief:an Americanos you understand that i mean what i say i believe my most
intimate friends would never have gathered.

  A collarbutton which had always not nothurt me not much and in the same place.

  Why according to tomorrow's paper the proletariat will not rise yesterday.

  Inexpressible itchings to be photographed with Lord Rothermere playing with
Lord Rothermere billiards very well by moonlight with Lord Rothermere.

  A crocodile eats a native,who in revenge beats it insensible with a banana,
establishing meanwhile a religious cult based on consubstantial intangibility.

  Personne ne m'aime et j'ai les mains froides.

  His Royal Highness said "peek-a-boo" and thirty tame fleas left the prettily
embroidered howdah immediately.

  Thumbprints of an angel named Frederick found on a lightning-rod,Boston,Mass.

  such were the not unhurried reflections to which my organ of imperception gave
birth to which i should ordinarily have objected to which,considering the back-
ground^ is hardly surprising if anyone hardly should call exactly extraordin-
ary. We refer,of course,to my position. A bachelor incapable of occupation,he
had long suppressed the desire to suppress the suppressed desire of shall we
say:Idleness,while meaning its opposite?      Nothing could be clearer to all con-
cerned than that i am not a policeman.

  Meanwhile the tea regressed.

candle furnished by courtesy of the management on Thursdays,opposite which a
church stood perfectly upright but not piano item:a watermelon causes indigestion

  By this time,however,the flight of crows had ceased.       I withdrew my hands from
the tennisracket.     All was over.   One brief convulsive octopus,and then our hero
folded his umbrella.


  It seemed too beautiful.


  Let us perhaps excuse me if i repeat himself :these,or nearly these,were the not
unpainful thoughts which occupied the subject of our attention;to speak even less
objectively,i was horribly scared i would actually fall off the rail before the
really train after all arrived. If i should have made this perfectly clear,it
entirely would have been not my fault.

down ever so far on the beach below me a little girl in white spins,

     the crackle of a typewriter,in the afternoon sky.
goats and sheep are driven by somebody along a curve of road which
     eats into a pink cliff back and up leaning out of yellowgreen

a bird chirps in a tree,somewhere nowhere

beyond these elements

remarkably nothing is....therefore,lady

to become the jumping puppets of a dream?       oh i mean:
entirely having in my careful how
careful arms created this at length
inexcusable,this inexplicable pleasure--you go from several
persons:believe me that strangers arrive
when i have kissed you into a memory
slowly,oh seriously
--that since and if you disappear

solemnly
myselves
ask "life,the question how do i drink dream smile

and how do i prefer this face to another and
why do i weep eat sleep--what does the whole intend"
they wonder, oh and they cry "to be,being,that i am alive
this absurd fraction in its lowest terms
with everything cancelled
but shadows
--what does it all come down to? love?        Love
if you like and i like,for the reason that i
hate people and lean out of this window is love,iove
and the reason that i laugh and breathe is oh love and the reason

that i do not fall into this street is love."

flower in his buttonhole

should please him or i wonder what he does)

under some dirty collars)only a
moment

was it perhaps a year)ago i found staring

me in the face a dead yellow small rose

it is so long since my heart has been with yours

shut by our mingling arms through
a darkness where new lights begin and
increase,
since your mind has walked into
my kiss as a stranger
into the streets and colours of a town--

that i have perhaps forgotten
how,always(from
these hurrying crudities
of blood and flesh)Love
coins His most gradual gesture,

and whittles life to eternity

--after which our separating selves become museums
filled with skilfully stuffed memories

i am a beggar always
who begs in your mind

(slightly smiling,patient,unspeaking
with a sign on his
breast
BLIND)yes i

am this person of whom somehow
you are never wholly rid(and who

does not ask for more than
just enough dreams to
live on)
         after all,kid

you might as well
toss him a few thoughts

a little love preferably,
anything which you can't
pass off on other people:for
instance a
plugged promise--

then he will maybe(hearing something
fall into his hat)go wandering
after it withfingers;tillhaving

found
what was thrown away
                         himself
taptaptaps out of your brain,hopes,life

how myself has been coarse and dull

and cling
to my mind always

But now she sharpens and becomes crisper
until i smile with knowing

gesture lightly my eyes?
And send life out of me and the night
absolutely into me....a wise
and puerile moving of your arm will
do suddenly that

armour colliding on huge blue horses,

along the brittle treacherous bright streets
of memory comes my heart,singing like
an idiot,whispering like a drunken man

who(at a certain corner,suddenly)meets
the tall policeman of my mind.
                                   awake
being not asleep,elsewhere our dreams began
which now are folded:but the year completes
his life as a forgotten prisoner

--"Ici?"--"Ah non,mon cheri;il fait trop froid"--
they are gone:along these gardens moves a wind bringing
rain and leaves,filling the air with fear
and sweetness....pauses.     (Halfwhispering....halfsinging

                       IV

our touching hearts slenderly comprehend
(clinging asfingers,lovingone another
gradually into hands)and bend
into the huge disaster of the year:

like this most early single star which tugs

weakly at twilight,caught in thickening fear
our slightlyfingeringspirits starve and smother;
until autumn abruptly wholly hugs

our dying silent minds,which hand in hand
at some window try to understand
the
   (through pale miles of perishing air,haunted
with huddling infinite wishless melancholy,
suddenly looming)accurate undaunted

moon's bright third tumbling slowly

if i have made,my lady,intricate
imperfect various things chiefly which wrong
your eyes(frailer than most deep dreams are frail)
songs less firm than your body's whitest song
upon my mind--if i have failed to snare
the glance too shy--if through my singing slips
the very skilful strangeness of your smile
the keen primeval silence of your hair

--let the world say "his most wise music stole
nothing from death"--
                        you only will create
(who are so perfectly alive)my shame:
lady through whose profound and fragile lips
the sweet small clumsy feet of April came

into the ragged meadow of my soul.

"Gay" is the captivating cognomen of a Young Woman of cambridge,mass.
to whom nobody seems to have mentioned ye olde freudian wish;
when i contemplate her uneyes safely ensconced in thick glass
you try if we are a gentleman not to think of(sh)

the world renowned investigator of paper sailors--argonauta argo
harmoniously being with his probably most brilliant pupil mated,
let us not deem it miraculous if their(so to speak)offspring has that largo
appearance of somebody who was hectocotyliferously propagated

when Miss G touched n.y. our skeleton stepped from his cupboard
gallantly offering to demonstrate the biggest best busiest city
and presently found himself rattling for that well known suburb
the bronx(enlivening an otherwise dead silence with harmless quips,out of Briggs
     by Kitty)

arriving in an exhausted condition,i purchased two bags of lukewarm peanuts
with the dime which her mama had generously provided(despite courteous
     protestations)
and offering Miss Gay one(which she politely refused)set out gaily for the hyenas
suppressing my frank qualms in deference to her not inobvious perturbations

unhappily,the denizens of the zoo were that day inclined to be uncouthly erotic
more particularly the primates--from which with dignity square feet turned
     abruptly Miss Gay away:
"on the whole"(if you will permit a metaphor savouring slightly of the demotic)
Miss Gay had nothing to say to the animals and the animals had nothing to say to
     Miss Gay

during our return voyage,my pensive companion dimly remarked something about
     "stuffed
fauna" being "very interesting"...we also discussed the possibility of rain...
in distant proximity to a Y.W.c.a. she suddenly luffed
--thanking me;and(stating that she hoped we might "meet again

sometime")vanished,gunwale awash. I thereupon loosened my collar
and dove for the nearest 1surreptitiously cogitating
the dictum of a new england sculptor(well on in life)re the helen moller
dancers,whom he considered "elevating--that is,if dancing CAN be elevating"

Miss(believe it or)Gay is a certain Young Woman unacquainted with the libido
and pursuing a course of instruction at radcliffe college,cambridge,mass.

i am a shape that can but eat and turd

a coward waiting clumsily to cease

a hand's impression in an empty glove,
a soon forgotten tune,a house for lease.

behold this fool who,in the month of June,
having of certain stars and planets heard,
rose very slowly in a tight balloon
until the smallening world became absurd;
him did an archer spy(whose aim had erred

he shot the aeronaut down,into the abyss
--and wonderfully i fell through the green groove
of twilight,striking into many a piece.
I have never loved you dear as now i love

collects the image of one fatal word;
so that my life(which liked the sun and the moon)
resembles something that has not occurred:
i am a birdcage without any bird,
a collar looking for a dog,a kiss
without lips;a prayer lacking any knees
but something beats within my shirt to prove
he is undead who,living,noone is.
I have never loved you dear as now i love.

you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens

my life will shut very beautifully,suddenly,
as when the heart of this flower imagines
the snow carefully everywhere descending;

nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
the power of your intense fragility:whose texture
compels me with the colour of its countries,
rendering death and forever with each breathing

but being not amazing:without love
separate,smileless--merely imagine your

sorrow a certain reckoning demands...

marvelling And what may have become of
with his gradual acute lusting glance
an alert clumsily foolishwise

(tracking the beast Tomorrow by her spoor)
over the earth wandering hunter whom you
knew once?

            what if(merely suppose)

mine should overhear and answer Who
with the uselessflanksand cringing feet
is this(shivering pale naked very poor)
creature of shadow,that among first light

groping washes my nightmare from his eyes?

nothing is more exactly terrible than
to be alone in the house,with somebody and
with something)
                   You are gone, there is laughter

and despair impersonates a street

i lean from the window,behold ghosts,
                                       a man
hugging a woman in a park.      Complete.

and slightly(why?or lest we understand)
slightly i am hearing somebody
coming up stairs,carefully
(carefully climbing carpeted flight after
carpeted flight,  in stillness,climbing
the carpeted stairs of terror)

and continually i am seeing something

inhaling gently a cigarette(in a mirror

(and such a day as must remember he
who watched unhands describe what mimicry,

with angry seasalt and indignant clover
marrying to themselves Life's animals)

but not darkness shall quite outmarch forever
--and i perceive,within transparent walls
how several smoothly gesturing stars are clever
to persuade even silence:therefore wonder

opens a gate;the prisoner dawn embraces

hugely some few most rare perfectly dear
(and worlds whirl beyond worlds:immortal yonder
collidingly absorbs eternal near)

       but if a living dance upon dead minds
       why,it is love;but at the earliest spear
       of sun perfectly should disappear
       moon's utmost magic,or stones speak or one
       name control more incredible splendor than
       our merely universe,love's also there:
       and being here imprisoned,tortured here
       love everywhere exploding maims and blinds
       (but surely does not forget,perish,sleep
       cannot be photographed,measured;disdains
       the trivial labelling of punctual brains...
       --Who wields a poem huger than the grave?
       from only Whom shall time no refuge keep
       though all the weird worlds must be opened?

so standing,our eyesfilledwith wind,and the
whining rigging over us,i implore you to
notice how the keen ship lifts(skilfully
like some bird which is all birds but more fleet)
herself against the air--and whose do you
suppose possibly are certain hands,terse
and invisible,with large first new stars
knitting the structure of distinct sunset

driving white spikes of silence into joists
hewn from hugest colour
                          (and which night hoists
miraculously above the always
beyond such wheres and fears or any when
unwondering immense directionless
horizon)
         --do you perhaps know these workmen?

                    LXX

here is the ocean,this is moonlight:say
that both precisely beyond either were--
so in darkness ourselves go,mind in mind

which is the thrilling least of all(for love's
secret supremely clothes herself with day)

i mean,should any curious dawn discuss
our mingling spirits,you would disappear
unreally;as this planet(understand)

forgets the entire and perpetual sea

--but if yourself consider wonderful
that your(how luminous)life toward twilight will
dissolve reintegrate beckon through me,
i think it is less wonderful than this

only by you my heart always moves

Jehovah buried,Satan dead,
do fearers worship Much and Quick;
badness not being felt as bad,
itself thinks goodness what is meek;
obey says toc,submit says tic,
Eternity's a Five Year Plan:
if Joy with Pain shall hang in hock
who dares to call himself a man?

go dreamless knaves on Shadows fed,
your Harry's Tom,your Tom is Dick;
while Gadgets murder squawk and add,
the cult of Same is all the chic;
by instruments,both span and spic,
are justly measured Spic and Span:
to kiss the mike if Jew turn kike
who dares to call himself a man?

loudly for Truth have liars pled,
their heels for Freedom slaves will click;
where Boobs are holy,poets mad,
illustrious punks of Progress shriek;
when Souls are outlawed,Hearts are sick,
Hearts being sick,Minds nothing can:
if Hate's a game and Love's a fuck
who dares to call himself a man?

King Christ,this world is all aleak;
and lifepreservers there are none:
and waves which only He may walk
Who dares to call Himself a man.

and a hundred joys high are such shoulders
as cowards will scheme
to harness:let all
unfools of unbeing

set traps for his heart,
lay snares for his feet
(who wanders through only white darkness
who moves in black light

dancing isn'ts on why,digging bridges with mirrors
from whispers to stars;
climbing silence for ifs
diving under because)

freely to give
as gives a friend
not those who slave
unselves to lend

must coo or boo
may strut or creep
ungenerous who

ape deftly aims
they dare not share)
such make their names
(this poet made war

v/hose naught and all
sun are and moon

love's function is to fabricate unknownness

(known being wishless;but love,all of wishing)
though life's lived wrongsideout,sameness chokes oneness
truth is confused with fact,fish boast of fishing

and men are caught by worms(love may not care
if time totters,light droops,all measures bend
nor marvel if a thought should weigh a star
--dreads dying least;and less,that death should end)

how lucky lovers are(whose selves abide
under whatever shall discovered be)
whose ignorant each breathing dares to hide
more than most fabulous wisdom fears to see

(who laugh and cry)who dream,create and kill
while the whole moves;and every part stands still:

   New Poems

[from COLLECTED POEMS]


                        I N T R O D U C T I O N

The poems to come are for you and for me and are not for mostpeople
   --it's no use trying to pretend that mostpeople and ourselves are alike.
Mostpeople have less in common with ourselves than the squarerootof-
minusone. You and I are human beings;mostpeople are snobs.
   Take the matter of being born. What does being born mean to most-
people? Catastrophe unmitigated. Socialrevolution. The cultured
aristocrat yanked out of his hyperexclusively ultravoluptuous super-
palazzo,and dumped into an incredibly vulgar detentioncamp swarming
with every conceivable species of undesirable organism. Mostpeople
fancy a guaranteed birthproof safetysuit of nondestructible selflessness.
If mostpeople were to be born twice they'd improbably call it dying--
   you and I are not snobs. We can never be born enough. We are human
beings;for whom birth is a supremely welcome mystery,the mystery of
growing:the mystery which happens only and whenever we are faithful
to ourselves. You and I wear the dangerous looseness of doom and find it
becoming. Life,for eternal us,is now;and now is much too busy being a
little more than everything to seem anything,catastrophic included.
   Life,for mostpeople,simply isn't. Take the socalled standardofliving.
What do mostpeople mean by "living"? They don't mean living. They
mean the latest and closest plural approximation to singular prenatal
passivity which science,in its finite but unbounded wisdom,has suc-
ceeded in sellingtheirwives. Ifscience could fail,a mountain's a mammal.
Mostpeople's wives can spot a genuine delusion of embryonic omni-
potence immediately and will accept no substitutes
   --luckily for us,a mountain is a mammal. The plusorminus movie to
end moving,the strictly scientific parlourgame of real unreality,the
tyranny conceived in misconception and dedicated to the proposition
that every man is a woman and any woman a king,hasn't a wheel to stand
on. What their most synthetic not to mention transparent majesty,
mrsandmr collective foetus,would improbably call a ghost is walking.
He isn't an undream of anaesthetized impersons,or a cosmic comfort-
station,or a transcendentally sterilized lookiesoundiefeelietastiesmellie.
He is a healthily complex,a naturally homogeneous,citizen of immor-
tality. The now ofhis each pitying free imperfect gesture,his any birth or
hreathing,insults perfected inframortally millenniums of slavishness.
He is a little more than everything,he is democracy;he is alive:he is
ourselves.
   Miracles are to come. With you I leave a remembrance of miracles:
they are by somebody who can love and who shall be continually reborn,

a human being;somebody who said to those near him,when his fingers
would not hold a brush "tie it into my hand"--
   nothing proving or sick or partial. Nothing false,nothing difficult or
easy or small or colossal. Nothing ordinary or extraordinary,nothing
emptied or filled,real or unreal;nothing feeble and known or clumsy and
guessed. Everywhere tints childrening,innocent spontaneous,true. No-
where possibly what flesh and impossibly such a garden,but actually
flowers which breasts are among the very mouths of light. Nothing be-
lieved or doubted;brain over heart, surface:nowhere hating or to fear;
shadow,mind without soul. Only how measureless coolflamesofmaking;
only each other building always distinct selves of mutual entirely open-
ing;only alive. Never the murdered finalities of wherewhen and yesno,
impotent nongames of wrongright and rightwrong;never to gain or
pause,never the soft adventure ofundoom,greedy anguishes and cringing
ecstasies of inexistence;never to rest and never to have:only to grow.
  Always the beautiful answer who asks a more beautiful question

birds who are the secrets of living
whatever they sing is better than to know
and if men should not hear them men are old

may my mind stroll about hungry

and may myself do nothing usefully

you shall above all things be glad and young.
For if you're young,whatever life you wear

it will become you;and if you are glad
whatever's living will yourself become.
Girlboys may nothing more than boygirls need:
i can entirely her only love

whose any mystery makes every man's
flesh put space on;and his mind take off time

that you should ever think,may god forbid
and(in his mercy)your true lover spare:
for that way knowledge lies,the foetal grave
called progress,and negation's dead undoom.

I'd rather learn from one bird how to sing
than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance

       my father moved through dooms of love
       through sames of am through haves ofgive,
       singing each morning out of each night
       my father moved through depths of height

       this motionless forgetful where
       turned at his glance to shining here;
       that if(so timid air is firm)
       under his eyes would stir and squirm

       newly as from unburied which
       floats the first who,his april touch
       drove sleeping selves to swarm their fates
       woke dreamers to their ghostly roots

       and should some why completely weep
       my father's fingers brought her sleep:
       vainly no smallest voice might cry
       for he could feel the mountains grow.

       Lifting the valleys of the sea
       my father moved through griefs ofjoy;
       praising a forehead called the moon
       singing desire into begin

       joy was his song and joy so pure
       a heart of star by him could steer
       and pure so now and now so yes
       the wrists of twilight would rejoice

       keen as midsummer's keen beyond
       conceiving mind of sun will stand,
       so strictly(over utmost him
       so hugely)stood my father's dream

       hisfleshwasfleshhis blood was blood:
       no hungry man but wished him food;
       no cripple wouldn't creep one mile
       uphill to only see him smile.

       Scorning the pomp of must and shall
       my father moved through dooms of feel;
       his anger was as right as rain

septembering arms of year extend
less humbly wealth to foe and friend
than he to foolish and to wise
offered immeasurable is


proudly and(by octobering flame
beckoned)as earth will downward climb,
so naked for immortal work
his shoulders marched against the dark


his sorrow was as true as bread:
no liar looked him in the head;
if every friend became his foe
he'd laugh and build a world with snow.


My father moved through theys of we,
singing each new leaf out of each tree
(and every child was sure that spring
danced when she heard my father sing)


then let men kill which cannot share,
let blood and flesh be mud and mire, .
scheming imagine,passion willed,
freedom a drug that's bought and sold


giving to steal and cruel kind,
a heart to fear,to doubt a mind,
to differ a disease of same,
conform the pinnacle of am


though dull were all we taste as bright,
bitter all utterly things sweet,
maggoty minus and dumb death
all we inherit,all bequeath


and nothing quite so least as truth
--i say though hate were why men breathe--
because my father lived his soul
love is the whole and more than all

love is the every only god

who spoke this earth so glad and big
even a thing all small and sad
man,may his mighty briefness dig

for love beginning means return
seas who could sing so deep and strong

one querying wave will whitely yearn
from each last shore and home come young

so truly perfectly the skies
by merciful love whispered were,
completes its brightness with your eyes

and starved on space?


love's murdered eye
dissected to mere
because and why?

By handless hints
do conjurers rule?
do mannikins
forbid the soul?


is death a whore
with life's disease
which quacks will cure
when pimps may please?

love is more thicker than forget
more thinner than recall
more seldom than a wave is wet
more frequent than to fail

it is most mad and moonly
and less it shall unbe
than all the sea which only
is deeper than the sea

love is less always than to win
less never than alive
less bigger than the least begin
less littler than forgive

it is most sane and sunly
and more it cannot die
than all the sky which only
is higher than the sky

when every thrush may sing no new moon in
if all screech-owls have not okayed his voice
--and any wave signs on the dotted line
or else an ocean is compelled to close

when the oak begs permission of the birch
to make an acorn--valleys accuse their
mountains of having altitude--and march
denounces april as a saboteur

who sharpens every dull
here comes the only man
reminding with his bell
to disappear a sun

and out of houses pour
maids mothers widows wives
bringing this visitor
their very oldest lives

one pays him with a smile
another with a tear
some cannot pay at all
he never seems to care

he sharpens is to am
he sharpens say to sing
you'd almost cut your thumb
so right he sharpens wrong

and when their lives are keen
he throws the world a kiss
and slings his wheel upon
his back and off he goes

but we can hear him still
if now our sun is gone
reminding with his bell
to reappear a moon

         stillnessjwhile

        enormous this how

       patient creature(who's
       never by never robbed of
       day)puts always on by always

         dream,is to

          taste
           not(beyond
            death and

              life)imaginable mysteries

                           3

now air is air and thing is thing:no bliss

of heavenly earth beguiles our spirits,whose
miraculously disenchanted eyes

live the magnificent honesty ofspace.

Mountains are mountains now;skies now are skies--
and such a sharpening freedom lifts our blood
as if whole supreme this complete doubtless

universe we'd(and we alone had)made

--yes;or as if our souls,awakened from
summer's green trance,would not adventure soon
a deeper magic:that white sleep wherein
all human curiosity we'll spend
(gladly,as lovers must)immortal and

the courage to receive time's mightiest dream

maggie and milly and molly and may
went down to the beach(to play one day)

and maggie discovered a shell that sang
so sweetly she couldn't remember her troubles,and

milly befriended a stranded star

and molly was chased by a horrible thing
which raced sideways while blowing bubbles:and

may came home with a smooth round stone
as small as a world and as large as alone.

--saharas have their centuries;ten thousand
of which are smaller than a rose's moment

there's time for laughing and there's time for crying--

but more than all(as all your more than eyes
tell me)there is a time for timelessness

these from my mother's greatgrandmother's rosebush white

roses are probably the least probable roses
of her improbable world and without any doubt
of impossible ours
                   --God's heaven perhaps comprises
poems(my mother's greatgrandmother surely would know)
of purest poem and glories of sheerest glory
a little more always less believably so
than(how should even omnipotent He feel sorry
while these were blossoming)roses which really are dreams
ofroses--
           "and who" i asked my love "could begin
to imagine quite such eagerly innocent whoms
of merciful sweetness except Himself?"

i am a little church(no great cathedral)
far from the splendor and squalor of hurrying cities
--i do not worry if briefer days grow briefest,
i am not sorry when sun and rain make april


my life is the life of the reaper and the sower;
my prayers are prayers of earth's own clumsily striving
(finding and losing and laughing and crying)children
whose any sadness or joy is my grief or my gladness


around me surges a miracle of unceasing
birth and glory and death and resurrection:
over my sleeping self float flaming symbols
of hope,and i wake to a perfect patience of mountains


i am a little church(far from the frantic
world with its rapture and anguish)at peace with nature
--i do not worry if longer nights grow longest;
i am not sorry when silence becomes singing


winter by spring,i lift my diminutive spire to
merciful Him Whose only now is forever:
standing erect in the deathless truth of His presence
(welcoming humbly His light and proudly His darkness)

wealthier by a single sweet day's death:
as not imagined secrecies comprise

goldenly huge whole the upfloating moon.

but we've the may
(for you are in love
and i am)to sing,
my darling:while
old worlds and young
(big little and all
worlds)merely have
the must to say

and the when to do
is exactly theirs
(dull worlds or keen;
big little and all)
but lose or win
(come heaven,come hell)
precisely ours
is the now to grow

it's love by whom
(my beautiful friend)
the gift to live
is without until:
but pitiful they've

no power beyond
the trick to seem

their joys turn woes
and right goes wrong

big little and all)
whereas(my sweet)
 our summer in fall
 and in winter our spring
 is the yes of yes

 love was and shall
 be this only truth
 (a dream of a deed,
 born not to die)
 but worlds are made
 of hello and goodbye:
 glad sorry or both

a lover and his only love,
strolling slowly(mind in mind)
through some green mysterious land

until my second dream begins--
the sky is wild with leaves;which dance
and dancing swoop(and swooping whirl
over a frightened boy and girl)

but that mere fury soon became
silence:in huger always whom
two tiny selves sleep(doll by doll)
motionless under magical

foreverfully falling snow.
And then this dreamer wept:and so
she quickly dreamed a dream of spring

 in heavenly realms of hellas dwelt
 two very different sons ofzeus:
 one,handsome strong and born to dare
 --afighterto his eyelashes--
 the other,cunning ugly lame;
 but as you'll shortly comprehend
 a marvellous artificer

 now Ugly was the husband of
 (as happens every now and then
 upon a merely human plane)
 someone completely beautiful;
 and Beautiful,who(truth to sing)
 could never quite tell right from wrong
 took brother Fearless by the eyes
 and did the deed ofjoy with him

 then Cunning forged a web so subtle
 air is comparatively crude;
 an indestructible occult
 supersnare of resistless metal:
 and(stealing toward the blissful pair)
 skilfully wafted over them-
 selves this implacable unthing

next,our illustrious scientist
 petitions the celestial host
to scrutinize his handiwork:
they(summoned by that savage yell
from shining realms of regions dark)
laugh long at Beautiful and Brave
--wildly who rage,vainly who strive;
and beingfinallyreleased
flee one another like the pest

thus did immortal jealousy
quell divine generosity,
thus reason vanquished instinct and
matter became the slave of mind;
thus virtue triumphed over vice
and beauty bowed to ugliness
and logic thwarted life:and thus--
but look around you,friends and foes

my tragic tale concludes herewith:

one winter afternoon

(at the magical hour
when is becomes if)

a bespangled clown
standing on eighth street
handed me a flower.

Nobody,it's safe
to say,observed him but

myself;and why?because

without any doubt he was
whatever(first and last)

a mystery for which i've
no word except alive

--that is,completely alert
and miraculously whole;

with not merely a mind and a heart

but unquestionably a soul--
by no means funereally hilarious

(or otherwise democratic)
but essentially poetic
or ethereally serious:

a fine not a coarse clown
(no mob,but a person)

and while never saying a word

who was anything but dumb;
since the silence of him

self sang like a bird.
Mostpeople have been heard
screaming for international

measures that render hell rational

enough to give me a daisy

     TO WILLIAM F. BRADBURY

Leader and teacher, we whom you have taught,
Knowing that nothing ever can repay
The friendly aid that marked your honored stay,
Arise to thank and bless you. Where we sought
For help in that with which we could do naught,
You were at hand, prepared to show the way,
And when we came to you in sore dismay
You made most clear the path with perils fraught.

Now when wefindourselves about to lose
Your leadership, whose strength will ever dwell
In us and by us to the very end,
We know no better title we can use
In wishing you afinal,fond farewell,
Than that whichfitsyou best,--our faithful friend!

         THE COMING OF MAY
                      Ballade

We have wintered the death of the old, cold year,
We have left our tracks in the melting snow,
We have braved harsh March's biting jeer,
And April's gusty overflow.
And now, when Nature begins to grow,
And the buds are out, and the birds are gay
And all is well--above and below,--
Here's to the coming of blithesome May.

Winter was good when he met us here,
With his sharp, clear days, and hisflashingsnow,
But we carried Winter out on his bier,
And buried him, many a month ago.
March was not hard with all his blow,
With April, Spring seemed on her way,
But we've reached the best at last, and so
Here's to the coming of blithesome May.

Winter has ended his cold career,--
No more death, and no more woe,--
We've come at last to a different sphere,
With no more freezing, and--mistletoe.
Spring in coming was very slow,--
Altogether too much delay,--
But we've cheered her on from foe to foe:
Here's to the coming of blithesome May.

Envoi

Think of the gratitude all must owe,--
Heaven has visited earth to-day.--
All the earth's in a warm, glad glow.--
Here's to the coming of blithesome May!

BALLAD OF THE SCHOLAR'S LAMENT

When I have struggled through three hundred years
   Of Roman history, and hastened o'er
Some French play--(though I have my private fears
   Offlunkingsorely when I take the floor
In class),--when I have steeped my soul in gore
   And Greek, andfiguredover half a ream
With Algebra, which I do (not) adore,
   How shall I manage to compose a theme?

It's well enough to talk of poor and peers,
   And munch the golden apples' shiny core,
And lay a lot of heroes on their biers;--
   While the great Alec, knocking down a score,
Takes out his handkerchief, boohoo-ing, "More!"--
   But harshly I awaken from my dream,
Tofinda new,--er,--privilege,--in store:
   How shall I manage to compose a theme?

After I've swallowed prophecies ofseers,
   And trailed Aeneas from the Trojan shore,
Learned how Achilles, after many jeers,
   On piggy Agamemnon got to sore,
And heard how Hercules, Esq., tore
   Around, and swept and dusted with a stream,
There's one last duty,--let's not call it bore,--
   How shall I manage to compose a theme?

Envoi

Of what avail is all my mighty lore?
   I beat my breast, I tear my hair, I scream:
"Behold, I have a Herculean chore.
   How shall I manage to compose a theme?"

              SKATING

Spring is past, and Summer's past,
  Autumn's come, and going;
Weather seems as though at last
  We might get some snowing.
Spring was good, and Summer better,
  But the best of all is waiting,--
Madame Winter--don't forget her.--
    O
           You
                 Skating!

Spring we welcomed when we met,
  Summer was a blessing;
Autumn points to school, but yet
  Let's be acquiescing.
Spring had many precious pleasures;
  Winter's on a different rating;
She has greater, richer treasures,--
    O
           You
                 Skating!

Gleam ofice, and glint ofsteel,
  Jolly, snappy weather;
Glide on ice and joy ofzeal,
  All, alone, together.
Fickle Spring! Who can imprint her?--
  Faithless while she's captivating;
Here's to trusty Madame Winter.--
    O
            You
                 Skating!

          METAMORPHOSIS

We've plodded through a weird and weary time,
 Called Winter by the calendar alone;
We have beheld an earth pool-deep in slime,
 Image a heaven of stone.

We've found life hid between the folds of mire,
 Sensed life in every place, heard life in tune.
The earth-shell cracks with underneath desire;
 Spring crawls from the cocoon.

Her puny wings vibrant with will to grow,
 She clings, expanding like an opening eye;
More large, more able, more developed, lo,
 The perfect butterfly.

                     VISION

The dim deep of a yellow evening slides
Across the green, and mingles with the elms.
A faint beam totters feebly in the west,
Trembles, and all the earth is wild with light,
Stumbles, and all the world is in the dark.

The huge black sleep above;--lo, two white stars.

Harvard, your shadow-walls, and ghost-toned tower,
Dim, ancient-moulded, vague, and faint, and far,
Is gone! And through thefleshI see the soul:
Colouring iron in red leaping flame,
The thunder-strokes of mighty, sweating men,
Furious hammers clashingfierceand high,--
And in a corner of the smithy coiled,
Black, brutal, massive-linked, the toil-wrought chain
Which is to bind God's right hand to the world.

                        7

                    MIST

Earth is become the seat of a new sea;
Above our heads the splendid surges roll,
Only each mountain, like a steadfast soul,
Up through the strangling billows towers free.
Huge finny forms of phosphorescence flee--
Weird shadows--through the deeps, or caracole
With the sea-horses on some eye-less shoal,
Quickening the leafage of a wave-tombed tree.
As a great miser, morbid with his gain,
Pricked by unhealthy frettings, drowns dismay
In gorging on his plunders, one by one,--
Sudden--out of the vault of Heaven, the Sun
Unlocks the rainbow's glory, and the day.
The air is strange with rare birds after rain.

                              8

                 WATER-LILIES

Behold--a mere like a madonna's head
Black-locked, enchapleted with lilies white;
By Him the Prince of Artists in Earth's sight,
Eons ere her most ancient master wed
With Immortality. Such lustre, spread
So livingly before our starting sight,
Cries in the accents of its primal might:
"This artist and his art were never dead!"
See, when Dawn paints still water with the skies,
The wreath of consecrated faces rise,
With parted lips in fragrancy of prayer;
Look, while the ripening Night bends Heaven's bough,
Upon the mere--each spiritual brow
Sleeps in thefloatinghalo of its hair.

                 MUSIC

Music is sweet from the thrush's throat!
    Oh little thrush
    With the holy note,
Like a footstep of God in a sick-room's hush
    My soul you crush.

Unstopped organ, from earthyou break
    To knock at the skies,
    And I can but shake
My fragile fetters, and with you rise
    Into Paradise.

But Love, your music requires not wings.
    To the common breed
    It clings, and sings:
"Heaven on earth is Heaven indeed.
    This is my creed."

           SUMMER SILENCE
              (Spenserian Stanza)

Eruptive lightnings flutter to and fro
Above the heights of immemorial hills;
Thirst-stricken air, dumb-throated, in its woe
Limply down-sagging, its limp body spills
Upon the earth. A panting silence fills
The empty vault of Night with shimmering bars
Of sullen silver, where the lake distils
Its misered bounty.--Hark! No whisper mars
The utter silence of the untranslated stars.

                             11


                       SUNSET

Great carnal mountains crouching in the cloud
That marrieth the young earth with a ring,
Yet still its thought builds heavenward, whence spring
Wee villages of vapor, sunset-proud.--
And to the meanest door hastes one pure-browed
White-fingered star, and little, childish thing,
The busy needle of her light to bring,
And stitch, and stitch, upon the dead day's shroud.
Poises the sun upon his west, a spark
Superlative,--and dives beneath the world;
From the day's fillets Night shakes out her locks;
List! One pure trembling drop of cadence purled--
"Summer!"--a meek thrush whispers to the dark.
Hark! the cold ripple sneering on the rocks!

                         12


                    BALLADE

The white night roared with a huge north-wind,
And he sat before his thundering flame,
    Quaffing holly-crowned wine.
"Say me, who is she, and whence came
The snow-white maid with the hair of Inde?
    For I will have her mine!"

"She was crouched in snow by the threshold, lord,
And we took her in (for the storm is loud),
    But who, we may not know.
For, poorly-clad, she is strangely proud,
And will not sit at the servants' board,
    But saith she comes ofthe snow."

"She shall sit by me," he sware amain;
"Go, ere another ash-stick chars,
    Ask of her whom she loves."
"We ask her, lord, and she saith, 'The stars.' "
And he sware, "I will kiss with kisses twain
    Those cheeks which are two white doves."

The wind had tucked in bed her earth,
And tiptoed over valley and hill,
    Humming a slumber-croon;
And all the shining night lay still,
And the rude trees dropped their hollow mirth;
    Silently came the moon.

He rose from the table, red with wine;
He put one hand against the wall,
    Swaying as he did stand;
Three steps took he in the breathless hall,
Said, "You shall love me, for you are mine."
    And touched her with his hand.

White stretched the north-land, white the south...
She was gone like a spark from the ash that chars;
    And "After her!" he sware...
They found the maid. And her eyes were stars,
A starry smile was upon her mouth,
    And the snow-flowers in her hair.

                    SONNET

A rain-drop on the eyelids of the earth,
That wakes the clod inflowers,and the skies
In depthless sunlight, and that mortifies
The soul, and drives it far from home and hearth
To seek the music of the Naiad's mirth
That laughs in falling waters, or surprise
The green tree--spirits with their dreaming eyes,
The rosy baby ofthe May hath birth.

Delicious dark the hive of heaven drips;
Now in the firmament all shining crowd
The trembling, yearning stars, that cannot speak
For perfect joy; now steals a shadowy cloud,
A radiant tear, across the moon's pale cheek.
Dumbly the glorious sky yields up her lips.

                         14

                    SONNET

Long since, the flicker brushed with shameless wing
The pale earth crucified, and to all lands
Bore the death-cry; uplifting her frail hands,
You aged maple, bowed with sorrowing,
Caught the red life. New skies new seasons bring.
Wee red men build their lodge ofyellow sands
In the primeval grass; the willow stands
Donned in her ermine, to be crowned with Spring.

How high the sky's vast purple palace towers!
And lo, the pride of majesty beguiled,
With playful hands, King Winter's laughing child,
Sweet April Heaven, from that royal brow
Hath plucked the snowy wreath ofcloud, and now
Flings from her lap the million fluttering flowers.

                           i5

Do you remember when theflutteringdusk,
Beating the west with faint wild wings, through space
Sank, with Night's arrow in her heart? The face
Of heaven clouded with the Day's red doom
Was veiled in silent darkness, and the musk
Of summer's glorious rose breathed in the gloom.

Then from the world's harsh voice and glittering eyes,
The awful rant and roar of men and things,
Forth fared we into Silence. The strong wings
Of Nature shut us from the common crowd;
On high, the stars like sleeping butterflies
Hung from the great grey drowsyflowersof cloud.

                N O C T U R N E


When the lithe moonlight silently
Leaped like a satyr to the grass,
Filling the night with nakedness,
All silently I loved my love
    In gardens of white ivory.


Three fragrant trees which guard the gates,
Three perfume-trees which sweeten nights,
Rise upon heaven, full of stars
And dripping with white radiance.
    Her body is more white than trees.


Five founts of Bacchus, honey-cold,
Five showers making drunk the lawns,
Spout up a dark delicious rain
Filling the earth with sleep and tears.
    Her tresses are more sweet than wine.


Seven flowers which breathe divinity,
Seven wondering blossoms of embrace,
Open their glory to the moon,
Kissing white immortality.
    Her mouth is chaster than a flower.


When the fleet moonlight silently
Fled like a white nymph down the grass,
Leaving the night to loneliness,
All songfully I loved my love
    In gardens of white ivory.


The strings are silver to my harp,
And all the frame is ebony
I think the moon is blossoming--
My hungry fingers bite the strings--
    My harp becomes a flower, and blooms.


The strings are golden to my harp,
And all the frame is as a rose.
I think the moon is quivering--
My longing fingers search the chords--
    My harp becomes a heart, and breaks.

When thefirstday-beam silently
Broke like an arrow from the east,
Quivering unto the heights of dawn,
All silently I left my love
    In gardens of white ivory.

There are three trees which stand like dreams
Before the gates ofivory;
The moon has withered in the west--
My harp has withered--Hail the day!
    (Wherefore this dagger at my thighs.)

There arefivefounts which play like sleep
Upon the gates ofivory;
The moon is songless in the west--
My harp is songless--Hail the day!
    (Wherefore this dagger at my hands.)

There are sevenflowerswhich smile like death
Within the gates of ivory;
The moon is broken in the west--
My harp is broken--Hail the day!
    (Wherefore this dagger at my heart.)

For that I have forgot the world these days,
To enter at the smokeless lodge, and take
Life naked at primeval hands, to make
Clean comrades of large things in mighty ways;
That I have wrestled with the huge dismays
Which make the high head bow, the strong heart quake,
That I have battled for a golden stake,
Richer by every terror and amaze,--

For that I have forgot the world her cries
In the vast painted silences, that men
Have meant me nothing, under the great skies,
Over the high hills of God's caress,--
Ye pitying elements!--be with me when
I kiss the little feet of foolishness.

             NIGHT

Night, with sunset hauntings;
A red cloud under the moon.
Here will I meet my love
Beneath hushed trees.

Over the silver meadows
Offlower-foldedgrass,
Shall come unto me
Her feet like arrows of moonlight.

Under the magic forest
Mute with shadow,
I will utterly greet
The blown star ofher face.

By white waters
Sheathed in rippling silence,
Shall I behold her hands
Hurting the dark with lilies.

Hush thee to worship, soul!
Now is thy movement oflove.
Night; and a red cloud
Under the moon.

No sunset, but a grey, great, struggling sky
Full of strong silence. In green cloisters throng
Shy nuns of evening, telling beads ofsong.
Swallows, like winged prayers, soar steadily by,
Hallowing twilight. From the faint and high,
Night waves her misting censers, and along
The world, the singing rises into strong,
Pure peace. Now earth and heaven twain raptures die.

I knew your presence in the twilight mist,
In the world-filling darkness, in the rain
That spoke in whispers,--for the world was kissed
And laid in sleep.--These wild, sweet, perfect things
Are little miracles your memory sings,
Till heart on heart makes us one music again.

I miss you in the dawn, of gradualfloweringlights
And prayer-pale stars that pass the drowsing-incensed hymns,
When early earth through all her greenly-sleeping limbs
Puts on the exquisite gold day. The Christlike sun
Moves to his resurrection in rejoicing heights,
And priestly hills partake of morning one by one.

I look for you when comes the beautiful blue moon,
When earth is as a queen whose soul hath taken flight,
Embalmed in the entire strength of perfect light.
The immense heaven, a vase ofutter silence, towers
Vastward, beyond where dreams the unawakened moon,
Holding infinity and her invisible flowers.

The hours drum up to sunset; now the west awakes
To armies. Suddenly across the firmament
Couriers of light spur forth their captain's high intent.
Now devout legions, mustering heavenward without cease,
Face the hushed hordes of night. A trumpet-radiance breaks--
I see the young ranked glories marching down to peace.

Twilight, and great with silence of beginning dreams,
Yet haunted still by broken hosts in brave retreat,
Of blameless cohorts whelmed into sublime defeat,
Which, darkly under world their ragged spears withdraw,
Shall rise tofirethe night in far victorious gleams,
When over the towered east leaps the white sword of dawn.

So do I want you, when in heavenly spaces God
Slips His white wonders on the silent trail of time;
When out the smoking eve begins to slowly climb
A great, red, fearsomeflower,about whose fatal face
The faint moths gather and die--till withered pale, she nod
Far in the west, and morn the little dreams shall chase.

Now is the world at peace; Heaven unto her heart
Holdeth sublimities afar from touch of day,
Presents divine the fates shall never take away,
Unfaded memories, immortal ponderings,
The little knock of prayer whereby are thrown apart
Those inner doors which lead into all priceless things.

O night, mother divine of poetry and stars!
O thou whose patient face is nearest unto God,
Thou of chaste feet with beautiful oblivion shod,
Having the dear, swift-winged dark within thy hands,--
The prison invisible of souls thy peace unbars,
And love and I rise up into unspoken lands.

            BALLAD OF LOVE

Where is my love! I cried.
Life, I bid thee to say.
Who hath taken away
Her who sate at my side.
For whiter is she than any pearl;
But the nights be lonely and dread.
Life, what hast thou done with thy loveliest girl?
    Look to the wood, She said.
For the white bird, O, the white bird,
Sleep he toucheth the white bird,
The white bird and the red.

Give me her eyes! I cried.
For I would kiss them asleep,
That are so cool and deep,
So soft and wondering wide.
Bluer are they than ponds of dream;
But the skies be grey o'erhead.
Life, where may the eyes ofthy fairest gleam?
    Look to thefield,She said.
For the blueflower,O, the blue flower,
Night he stilleth the blue flower,
The blueflowerand the red.

O, for her hair! I cried.
Her young and wonderful hair,
To hide my sorrow there,
In the heart of a shining tide.
For her hair is more yellow than Heaven's dawn;
But the world's last leaves be shed.
Life, where is thy youngest angel gone?
    Look to the west, She said.
For the yellow light, O, the yellow light,
Death he moweth the yellow light,
The yellow light and the red.

             BALLADE OF SOUL

Not for the naked make I this my prayer,
That up and down the streets of life do go,
Having, save rags, no pleasant thing to wear,
Albeit the timid ways have put on snow
Against such wind as only God can blow:
Well 'ware art Thou that these have no redress,
For always in Thine eyes is all distress
Of bodies that without due raiment be;
But are there Souls in winter garmentless,
Be with them, God! and pity also me.

Not for the hungry has my spirit care,
Whether their bodies shall befilledor no,
With whom the world her bounty will not share,
Wherefore they move on feeble feet and slow,
Feeling dear Death within their bodies grow:
Thou knowest these at pain beyond confess,
For sorrow never may Thy ears transgress,
Though lips be locked and pain shall hold the key;
But are there Souls whom hunger doth oppress.
Be with them, God! and pity also me.

Not for the homeless do I ask, where e'er
The lights of Hell their haunting faces show,
The legion undesired anywhere,
Whose hearts Love shall not build in,--who shall sow
And reap such loneliness as murder's woe:
Thy gracious mouth to these shall acquiesce,
Which is so very wonderful to bless
The plundered heart with joy held long in fee;
But are there Souls that know not Love's caress,
Be with them God! and pity also me.

Envoi

Father, for this we thank Thee without cesse:
Death is the body's birthright, as I guess,
But are there Souls that walk in hopelessness,
Be with them God! and pity also me.

                 SAPPHICS

When my life his pillar has raised to heaven,
When my soul has bleeded and builded wonders,
When my love of earth has begot fair poems,
   Let me not linger.

Ere my day be troubled ofcoming darkness,
While the huge whole sky is elate with glory,
Let me rise, and making my salutation,
   Stride into sunset.

                   SONNET

I dreamed I was among the conquerors,
Among those shadows, wonderfully tall,
Which splendidly inhabit the hymned hall
Whereof is "Fame" writ on its glorious doors.
Cloaked in green thunder are the sudden shores
Guarding the lintel's gold, whence of the wall
Leaps the white echo; and within, the fall
Is heard of the eternal feet ofwars.

Here, at high ease, saw I those purple lords,
Sipping the wine of unforgetfulness,
Upon thrones intimate with all the skies:
Roland, and Richard, 'mid the shining press;
Leonidas, belted with living swords;
And Albert, with the lions in his eyes.

I care not greatly
Should the world remember me
In some tomorrow.

There is a journey,
And who is for the long road
Loves not to linger.

For him the night calls,
Out of the dawn and sunset
Who has made poems.

                    BELGIUM

Oh thou that liftest up thy hands in prayer,
Robed in the sudden ruin of glad homes,
And trampledfieldswhich from green dreaming woke
To bring forth ruin and the fruit of death,
Thou pitiful, we turn our hearts to thee.

Oh thou that mournest thy heroic dead
Fallen in youth and promise gloriously,
In the deep meadows of their motherland
Turning the silver blossoms into gold,
The valor of thy children comfort thee.

Oh thou that bowest thy ecstatic face,
Thy perfect sorrows are the world's to keep!
Wherefore unto thy knees come we with prayer,
Mother heroic, mother glorious,
Beholding in thy eyes immortal tears.

      In Memory of "A House of Pomegranates"

Speak to me friend! Or is the world so wide
That souls may easily forget their speech,
And the strong love that binds us each to each
Who have stood together watching God's white tide
Pouring, and those bright shapes of dreams which ride
Through darkness; we who have walked the silent beach
Strown with strange wonders out of ocean's reach
Which the nextfloodin her great heart shall hide?

Do not forget me, though the sands should fall,
And many things be swept away in deep,
And a new vision uttered to the shore,--
If after days bespeak me not at all,
Nor other's praise awake my song from sleep,
Nor Poetry remember, anymore.

A gentleness for my dog
Afingerof Champagne Very well Madame
We are at Maxim's A.D. one thousand
nine hundred thirty
Carpets have been put under the bottles
so that their aristocratic arses
may not collide with life's difficulties
there are carpets to hide the earth
there are carpets to extinguish
the noise of the soles of the waiters' shoes
Drinks are sipped through straws
which you pull out of a little safety-dress
Delicacy
There are cigaretteholders between cigarette and man
there are silent people at the cars
there are service-stairs for those
who carry packages
and there's tissue paper around the packages
and there's paper around the tissue paper
there's all the paper you want that doesn't cost
anything paper nor tissue paper nor straws
nor champagne or so little
nor the advertisement-ashtray, nor the
advertisement-blotter nor the
advertisement-calendar nor the
advertisement-lights nor the
advertisement-pictures on the walls nor the
advertisement-furs on Madame the
advertisement-toothpicks the advertisement-fan and the advertisement wind
nothing costs anything and for nothing
real live servitors, tender you prospectuses in the street
Take it, it's free
the prospectus and the hand which tenders it
Don't close the door
the Blount will take care of that Tenderness
Up to the very stairs which know how to ascend by themselves
in the department stores
Days are made of felt
Men are made of fog The world is padded
without collision
You aren't crazy Some beans My dog
hasn't been sick yet

Quand les hommes descendaient des faubourgs

Je me souviens du premier mai mil neuf cent sept
quand regnait la terreur dans les salons dores
On avait interdit aux enfants d'aller a Pecole
dans cette baniieue occidentale ou ne parvenait qu'affaibli

Je me souviens de la manifestation Ferrer

have you given enough dreams to the lovers on the great boulevards
and the Louis XVI bed with a year's credit
In the cemeteries the people ofthis so-well-oiled country
hold themselves with the decency of the marble
Their little houses resemble
chimneypots

How much are chrysanthemums this year

Flowers for the deadflowersfor the great artistes
Money is also spent for ideals
And besides good deeds wear long black trailing gowns
on the stairs I only tell you that

When men came down from the suburbs
and at the Place de la Republique
the black wave formed like a shutting fist
the shops wore their shutters over their eyes
so as not to see the lightning pass
I remember thefirstof May nine hundred seven
when terror reigned in the gilded drawingrooms
The children had been forbidden to go to school
in that occidental district which was reached by only a feeble
distant echo of wrath
I remember the Ferrer manifestation
when on the Spanish embassy was crushed
the ink-flower of infamy
Paris not so long ago
thou hast seen the procession made for Jaures
and the Sacco-Vanzetti torrent

and the bullet so sure that all the social-fascist doctors
bent over the victim's body
will have a time making their searchingfingerswander under the lace-chemise
sounding with instruments of precision its already rotting heart
They won't find the usual remedy
and will fall into the hands of the rioters who will glue them to the wall

II sait avant de parler toutes les chansons de la nouvelle vie
II va vous echapper courir il rit deja
les astres descendent familierement sur la terre
C'est bien le moins qu'ils brulent en se posant

How sweet how sweet is the groan which comes out ofthe ruins.

I am a witness to the crushing ofa world out of date
I am a witness drunkenly to the stampingout of the bourgeois
Was there ever a finer chase than the chase we give
to that vermin whichflattensitself in every nook ofthe cities
I sing the violent domination of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat
for the annihilation ofthe bourgeoisie
for the total annihilation ofthat bourgeoisie

The fairest monument which can be erected
the most astonishing ofall statues
thefinestand most audacious column
the arch which is like the very prism of the rain
are not worth the splendid and chaotic heap
which is easily produced with a church and some dynamite
Try it and see

The pickaxe makes a hole in the heart of ancient docilities
crumblings are songs wherein suns revolve
Men and walls ofyesterday fall struck with the same thunder bolt
The bursting of gunfire adds to the landscape
a hitherto unknown gaiety
Those are engineers, doctors that are being executed
Death to those who endanger the conquest of October
Death to the traitors to the Fiveyearplan

To you Young Communists
Sweep out the human debris where lingers
the magical spider of the sign ofthe cross
Volunteers for socialist construction
Chase the old days before you like a dangerous dog

Stand up against your mothers
Abandon night pestilence and the family
You hold in your hands a laughing child
a child such as has never been seen
He knows before he can talk all the songs of the new life
He will get away from you to run he laughs already
the stars descend familiarly upon the earth
it's indeed the least which they burn in assuming
the black carrion of the egoists

Theflowersof cement and of stone
the long creepers of iron the blue ribbons of steel
have never dreamed of such a spring

    Intervention should begin with the appearance of Rumania on
the scene, on the pretext, for instance, of some trouble on the fron-
tier involving an official declaration of war by Poland and the joining
together of the troops of Wrangel which would have traversed
Rumania...On their return from the energetic conference of
London, entering the URSS from Paris, Ramzine and Leritchev

BALLAD OF AN INTELLECTUAL

Listen,you morons great and small
to the tale of an intellectuall
(and ifyou don't profit by his career
don't ever say Hoover gave nobody beer).

'Tis frequently stated out where he was born
that a rose is as weak as its shortest thorn:
they spit like quarters and sleep in their boots
and anyone dies when somebody shoots
and the sheriff arrives after everyone's went;
which isn't,perhaps,an environment
where you would(and I should)expect to find
overwhelming devotion to things ofthe mind.
But when it rains chickens we'll all catch larks
--to borrow a phrase from Karl the Marks.

As a child he was puny;shrank from noise
hated the girls and mistrusted the boise,
didn't like whisky,learned to spell
and generally seemed to be going to hell;
so his parents,encouraged by desperation,
gave him a classical education
(and went to sleep in their boots again
out in the land where women are main).

You know the rest:a critic of note,
a serious thinker,a lyrical pote,
lectured on Art from west to east
--did sass-seyeity fall for it? Cheast!
if a dowager balked at our hero's verse
he'd knock her cold with a page from Jerse;
why,he used to say to his friends,he used
"for getting a debutante give me Prused"
and many's the heiress who's up and swooned
after one canto by Ezra Pooned
(or--to borrow a cadence from Karl the Marx--
a biting chipmunk never barx).

But every bathtub will have its gin
and one man's sister's another man's sin
and a hand in the bush is a stitch in time
and Aint It All A Bloody Shime
and he suffered a fate which is worse than death
and I don't allude to unpleasant breath.

Our blooming hero awoke,one day,
tofindhe had nothing whatever to say:
which I might interpret^ust for fun)
as meaning the es of a be was dun
and I mightn't think(and you mightn't,too)
that a Five Year Plan's worth a Gay Pay Oo
and both ofus might irretrievably pause
ere believing that Stalin is Santa Clause:
which happily proves that neither ofus
is really an intellectual cus.

For what did our intellectual do,
when he found himself so empty and bio?
he pondered a while and he said,said he
"It's the social system,it isn't me!
Not I am a fake,but America's phoney!
Not I am no artist,but Art's bologney!
Or--briefly to paraphrase Karl the Marx--
'The first law of nature is,trees will be parx.' "

Now all you morons of sundry classes
(who read the Times and who buy the Masses)
ifyou don't profit by his career
don't ever say Hoover gave nobody beer.

For whoso conniveth at Lenin his dream
shall dine upon bayonets,isn't and seam
and a miss is as good as a mile is best
for ifyou're not bourgeois you're Eddie Gest
and wastelands live and waistlines die,
which I very much hope it won't happen to eye;
or as comrade Shakespeare remarked ofold
All that Glisters Is Mike Gold

(but a rolling snowball gathers no sparks
--and the same hold true of Karl the Marks).

               SEMI-SPRING

A thin, foul scattering of grim, grey snow,
Reaching out scrawny limbs, deep digs its nails
Into the bleeding face of suppliant earth,
And grins with all its broken, yellow teeth.

A warm, serene, soft heaven gazes down
With dreamy eyes upon thefiend-crampedworld.
The rosy eastern glow, the sun's I Come,
Patters about the sky, and coos, and smiles--
Sweet babe with tender, rose-begetting feet.

From a black corpse of tree, the hideous rasp
Of staring grackles, clucking and bowing each
In drivelling salute, splits the soft air
To inharmonious fragments; everywhere
A nervous, endless, hoarse, incessant chirp
Of sparrows telling all the evil news.

Ah, God--for the flower-air of Spring! To see
The world in bud! To press with eager feet
The dear, soft, thrilling green again! To be
Once more in touch with heaven upon earth!
One soul-toned thrush's perfect harmony,
One little warbler's huge felicity,
One buttercup! One perfect butterfly!

             THE PAPER PALACE

A clan of imps--morose and ugly things,
  Brown-bodies,evil-headed,slayers all,--
Has climbed the shuddering air with embryo wings
  And from my porch's beam slowly let fall
With toil unspeakable,a fairy ball,
A palace hung in either! Fine as cloth
  Moon-spun on elfin loom,each filmy wall,
Light as a buoyant cloudlet's feathery froth,
Frail as a lily's face,soft as a silver moth.

                   Ill

Night shall eat these girls and boys.
Time makes his meal of thee and me.
Love a broken doll shall be;
the moon and sun like tired toys

(with all whereat joined hearts rejoice)
shall drop softly into the sea.
Night shall eat these girls and boys.
Time makes his meal of thee and me.

Love,lady,prizeth wisely thee;
whose white and little hand annoys
the universal death,pardi:
whose most white body is his voice.
Night shall eat these girls and boys.

Kind is his mouth and smiling are his eyes,
Who rideth on that sunny pilgrimage,
And tears and laughter be his golden wage,
And that sweet carolling which never dies.
O Pilgrim of green springtide and blue skies,
Thy heart is dear to men of every age,
All sympathy is in thy withered page,
Whose soul was singing ere thy hand was wise.

'Tis not in marble that we worship thee,
But rather when the first white flower is come
To naked gardens, and immortal youth
Leaps to the world,--there shall thy worship be
In perfect simpleness and perfect truth,--
O singing soul no dying can make dumb!

Great Dante stands in Florence, looking down
In marble on the centuries. Ye spell,
Beaneath his feet who walked in Heaven and Hell,
"L'ltalia."  Here no longer lord and clown
Cringe, as of yore, to the immortal frown
Of him who loved his Italy too well:
Silent he stands, and like a sentinel
Stares from beneath those brows of dread renown.

Terrible, beautiful face, from whose pale lip
Anathema hurtled upon the world,
Stern mask, we read thee as an open scroll:
What if this mouth Hate's bitter smile has curled?
These eyes have known Love's starry fellowship;
Behind which trembles the tremendous soul.

Stand forthJohn Keats! On earth thou knew'st me not;
Steadfast through all the storms of passion,thou,
True to thy muse,and virgin to thy vow;
Resigned,if name with ashes were forgot,
So thou one arrow in the gold had'st shot!
I never placed my laurel on thy brow,
But on thy name I come to lay it now,
When thy bones wither in the earthly plot.
Fame is my name. I dwell among the clouds,
Being immortal,and the wreath I bring
Itself is Immortality. The sweets
Of earth I know not,more the pains,but wing
In mine own ether,with the crowned crowds
Born of the centuries.--Stand forthJohn Keats!

Only thou livest. Centuries wheel and pass,
And generations wither into dust;
Royalty is the vulgar food of rust,
Valor and fame, their days be as the grass;

What of today? vanitas, vanitas...
These treasures of rare love and costing lust
Shall the tomorrow reckon mold and must,
Ere, stricken of time, itself shall cry alas.

Sole sits majestic Death, high lord of change;
And Life, a little pinch of frankincense,
Sweetens the certain passing...from some sty

Leers even now the immanent face strange,
That leaned upon immortal battlements
To watch the beautiful young heroes die.

I have looked upon thee--and I have loved thee,
Loved thy mouth, whose curve is the moon's young crescent,
Loved thy beauty-blossoming eyes, and eyelids
    Petal-like, perfect;
I would brush the dew in a flashing rainbow
From thy face's twain mysterious flowers,
And, supremely throned on the lips' full luna,
    Soar into Heaven.

          (A translation from Sophocles's Electro)

This love of ours, you of my heart, is no light thing;
For I have seen it in the east and in the west,
And I have found it in the cloud and in the clear.
Are you not with me at all times, faithfully standing,
The soul of that golden prelude which is the childhood of day,
By each imperishable stanza called a moment,
Unto the splendid close, glory and light, envoi,
Followed with stars?
                       Verily you were near to me,
To watch the strong boy-swallows carolling in sunset,
To barter day and thought for night and ecstasy,
To dream great dreams, you of my heart; to live great lives.

You are the sunset. You are the long night of peace.
And dawn is of you, a thrilling glory frightening stars.

                           Ill

Thy face is a still white house of holy things,
Graced with the quiet glory of thy hair.
Upon thy perfect forehead the sweet air
Hath laid her beauty where girlhood clings.
Thine eyes are quivering celestial springs
Of naked immortality, and there
God hath Hope, where those twin angels stare,
That sometimes sleep beneath their sheltering wings.
The seals of love on those strong lips of thine
Are perfect still; thy cheeks await their kiss.
Thou art all virginal; God made thee His.
Lost in the unreal life, the deathful din,
Man bows himself before the Only Shrine--
Who shall go in, O God--who shall go in?

What is thy mouth to me?
A cup of sorrowful incense,
A tree of keen leaves,
An eager high ship,
A quiver of superb arrows.

What is thy breast to me?
A flower of new prayer,
A poem of firm light,
A well of cool birds,
A drawn bow trembling.

What is thy body to me?
A theatre of perfect silence,
A chariot of red speed;
And O, the dim feet
Of white-maned desires!

       DEDICATION

The white rose my soul
Is blown upon the ways.
Over the high earth
Valleys bring it forth,
And it is found upon mountains.

The white rose my soul
Knoweth all winds and wings,
All nests, all songs,
With each smiling star,
And every graceful day.

The white rose my soul
Is under the world's feet.
(Only thou dost hold,
In that how little hand,
The red rose my heart.)

I love you
For your little,startled,thoughtless ways,
For your ponderings,like soft dark birds,
And when you speak 'tis a sudden sunlight.

I love you
For your wide child eyes,and fluttering hands,
For the little divinities your wrists,
And the beautiful mysteries your fingers.

I love you.
Does the blossom study her day of life?
Is the butterfly vexed with an hour of soul?
I had rather a rose than live forever.

                       VII

After your poppied hair inaugurates
Twilight, with earnest of what pleading pearls;
After the carnal vine your beauty curls
Upon me, with such tingling opiates
As immobile my literal flesh awaits;
Ere the attent wind spiritual whirls
Upward the murdered throstles and the merles
Of that prompt forest which your smile creates;

Pausing, I lift my eyes as best I can,
Where twain frail candles close their single arc
Upon a water-colour by Cezanne.
But you, love thirsty, breathe across the gleam;
For total terror of the actual dark
Changing the shy equivalents of dream.

Moon-in-the-Trees,
The old canoe awaits you.
He is not, as you know, afraid of the dark,
And has unaided captured many stars.

The same tent expects your coming,
Moon-in-the-Trees.
You remember how the spruce smelled sweet
When the dawn was full of little birds?

In the ears of my days
Is a thunder of accomplished rivers;
In the nostrils of my nights
An incense of irrevocable mountains.

                             IX

When thou art dead,dead,and far from the splendid sin,
And the fleshless soul whines at the steep of the last abyss
To leave forever its heart acold in an earthy bed,

When,forth of the body which loved my body,the soul-within
Comes,naked from the pitiless metamorphosis,
What shall it say to mine,when we are dead,dead?

(When I am dead,dead, and they have laid thee in,
The body my lips so loved given to worms to kiss,
And the cool smooth throat,and bright hair of the head--).

You are tired,
(I think)
Of the always puzzle of living and doing;
And so am I.

Come with me, then,
And we'll leave it far and far away--
(Only you and I, understand!)

You have played,
(I think)
And broke the toys you were fondest of,
And are a little tired now;
Tired of things that break, and--
Just tired.
So am I.

But I come with a dream in my eyes tonight,
And I knock with a rose at the hopeless gate of your heart--
Open to me!
For I will show you the places Nobody knows,
And, if you like,
The perfect places of Sleep.

Ah, come with me!
I'll blow you that wonderful bubble, the moon,
That floats forever and a day;
I'll sing you the jacinth song
Of the probable stars;
I will attempt the unstartled steppes of dream,
Until I find the Only Flower,
Which shall keep (I think) your little heart
While the moon comes out of the sea.

Let us lie here in the disturbing grass,
And slowly grow together under the sky
Sucked frail by Spring,whose meat is thou,and I,
This hurrying tree,and yonder pausing mass
Hitched to time scarcely,eager to surpass
Space:for the day decides;0 let us lie
Receiving deepness,
Hearing,over

The poised,rushing night ring in the brim
Of Heaven;then,perpendicular odors stealing
Through curtains of new loosened dark;and one--
As the unaccountable bright sun
Becomes the horizon--
Bird,nearly lost,lost;wheeling,wheeling.

                   Sailed July, 1914

Auf wiedersehen! We part a litde while,
Friends alway, till what time we meet again.
Of this our life, the hours of sun and rain,
No palest flower the future can beguile;
Then let him frown his frown or smile his smile!
There are some things which have not lived in vain,
These which have made us men and which remain,
Tho' tide and time be lost 'twixt mile and mile.

Fear not, for thou shalt speak with me, my friend,
Who care not if this little journey's end
Lie past so great a gulf as never yields
One smallest murmur.--When the world's in sleep,
I will go out where God's white legions keep
A shining bivouac in celestial fields.

                           S.F.D.
            In Memory of Claude o'Dreams

Behold, I have taken at thy hands immortal wine
The fume whereof is ecstasy of perfect pain,
Which is more sweet than flowers unknown uttered of rain,
More potent than the fumbling might of the brute of brine.
Lo, my pale soul is blown upon far peaks with thine,
Steeped in star-terrible silence, at whose feet the plain
Murmurs of thought and time's illimitable refrain,
Upon whose brows eternity setteth high sign.

This thing hath been, by grace; one music in our souls,
One fane beyond the world, whence riseth sacrifice
Unto that god whom gifts invisible appease.
So be it when sunset's golden diapaison rolls.
Over our life--then shalt thou, smiling, touch the keys,
And draw me softly with thee into Paradise.

                            Ill

Softly from its still lair in Plympton Street
It stole on silent pads, and, raping space,
Shot onward in a fierce infernal race,
And shivered townward on revolving feet,
Skidded, fortuitously indiscreet;
And now a lady doth its bosom grace,
And now the 'phone, tingling its wild disgrace,
Telleth that hearts be broke and time is fleet.

O Watson, born beneath a generous star,
Oft have I seen thee draped upon a bar;
Thou might'st have slain us with a bloody couteau
And,

       O Watson, moriturus te saluto,

Infinite in thy fair beatitude;
But you could not do anything so rude.

O friend, who hast attained thyself in her,
Thy wife, the almost woman whose tresses are
The stranger part of sunlight, in the far
Nearness of whose frail eyes instantly stir

Unchristian perfumes more remote than myrrh,
Whose smiling is the swiftly singular
Adventure of one inadvertent star,
With angels previously a loiterer,

Friend, who dost thy unfearing soul pervert
From the perfection of its constancy
To that unspeakable fellowship of Art--

Receive the complete pardon of my heart,
Who dost thy friend a little while desert
For the sensation of eternity.

They have hung the sky with arrows,
Targes of jubilant flame, and helms of splendor,
Knives and daggers of hissing light, and furious swords.

They have hung the lake with moth-wings,
Blurs of purple, and shaggy warmths of gold,
Lazy curious wines, and curving curds of silver.

They have hung my heart with a sunset,
Lilting flowers, and feathered cageless flames,
Death and love: ashes of roses, ashes of angels.

A painted wind has sprung
Clean of the rotten dark,
Lancing the glutted wolves of rain.

The sky is carried by a blue assault.
Strident with sun the heights swarm,
The vasts bulge with banners.

Working angels
Shovel light in heaven.

To carnival, to carnival,
In ribbons of red fire,
With spokes of golden laughter,
God drives the jingling world.

You shall sing my songs, O earth.
With tilted lips and dancing throat shall you sing them,
The songs my poems.

You shall dream my dreams, O world.
Locked in the shining house of beautiful sleep,
Of the dreams my poems.

You shall smile my smile, love.
My eyes, my eyes have stroked the bird of your soul,
The bird my poems.

In Healey's Palace I was sitting--
Joe at the ivories, Irene spitting
Rag into the stinking dizzy
Misbegotten Hall, while Lizzie,
Like a she-demon in a rift
Of Heil-smoke, toured the booths, half-piffed.

I saw two rah-rahs--caps, soft shirts,
Match-legs, the kind of face that hurts,
The walk that makes death sweet--Ted Gore
And Alec Ross; they had that whore
Mary between them. Don't know which,
One looked; and May said: "The old bitch
Lulu, as I'm a virgin, boys!"
And I yelled back over the noise:
"Did that three-legged baby croak
That you got off the salesman-bloke?"

The beer-glass missed. It broke instead
On old man Davenport's bald head.
I picked a platter up, one-handed.
Right on her new straw lid it landed.
Cheest, what a crash!
                        Before you knew,
Ted slipped the management a new
Crisp five, and everyone sat down
But May, that said I'd spoiled her gown,
And me, that blubbered on her shoulder,
And kissed her shiny nose, and told her
I didn't mean to smash her...Crowst,
But I was beautifully soused!
I think Al called me "good old sport,"
And three smokes lugged out Davenport.

The awful darkness of the town
crushes;in rows
houses every one a different shade of brown
(unity in variety,I suppose).
It almost snows:
inside,the silly people are teaing with bread-and-butter sandwiches

talking of the weather,and who
married whom
(the sons of b--s)
--thin smiles glue
the pasteboard faces,and prevent
sawdust from pouring out of this
chink or that.
The gloom
is flat,
as a poor pancake is
flat;"My dear,our church sent
three thousand bandages only last week
to those poor soldiers"--Whew!
how they reel

those sweet people. But I'm
going into the Parthenon
to lap yaoorti with my eyes shut
tight.   Goodbye
Cambridge. I'm going

in to see Nichol,and devour shishkabob(what
's the time?
Five? I must be moving on,
leaving the houses-all-alike
thank God)and I guess I'll drop in and get Mike
to give me a high.

where people by huge whistles scooped from sleep land breathless
on their two feet, and look at her between bars.        She stands
greenly over the flat pasteboard hill with a little pink road
like a stand of spilled saw-dust.     The sentinel who walks asle
ep under apple-trees yawns.       The moon regards little whores
running down the prison yard into the dawn to shit, and she is
tickled too.     (Trees in morning are like strengths of young

box completely mysterious,on whose shut
lid in large letters but neatly is
inscribed "Immortality".     And not
go too near it,however people brag
of the wonderful things inside
which are altogether too good to miss--
but we'll go by,together,giving it a wide
berth.    Silently. Making our feet
think.   Holding our breath--
if we look at it we will want to touch it.
And we mustn't because(something tells me)

(I just saw a man in a taxi who looked like God)
a little sudden whore skilfully dying
in Somebody's arms,on the way to the theatre."--"Did
you?"--"And just suppose it were. Wouldn't poor Royce's
hair tremble? What would Old Man Emerson

and found myself.'"--"Probably."--"And think of this one:

my little heart is so wonderfully sorry
lady,to have seen you on its threshold
smiling,to have experienced the glory

of your slender and bright going, and it is so cold
(nothing being able to comfort its grief)
without you,that it would like i guess to die.
Also my lady do i feel as if
perhaps the newly darkening texture of my
upon nothing a little clumsily closing
mind will keep always something who has

fallen,who being beautiful is gone
and suddenly.     As if you will point at the evening

"in this particular place,my lover,the moon
unspeakably slender and bright was"

the spring has been exquisite and the
summer may be beautiful.         But,
tell me with eyes quiteshut
did you love me,will you love me

and perfectly so forth;i see,
kissing you--only kissing
you(it is still spring
and summer may be beautiful)shall we

say years?     O let us say it,girl
to boy smiling while the moments kill
us gently and infinitely.

And believe(do not believe)there'll
be a time when even these leaves will

crawl expensively away. My lady.

willing pitifully to bewitch
the nude worm of my reaching mind,to tease
its gropings curiously i remark these
frivolous slowlywinking lives which
(like four or three pretty flies)the
very and tremulous architecture
of frail light suddenly will capture.
And i think
             (as if perhaps a tree
should remember how Spring touched it)of your
deep kiss which constructs faindy
in me an upward country(on whose new shores
the first day has not come,but it is quaindy
always morning and silence)always where

hang,in the morning,wistful corpses of stars.

as
we lie side by side
my little breasts become two sharp delightful strutting towers and
i shove hody the lovingness of my belly against you

your arms are
young;
your arms will convince me,in the complete silence speaking
upon my body
their ultimate slender language.

do not laugh at my thighs.

there is between my big legs a crisp city.
when you touch me
it is Spring in the city;the streets beautifully writhe,
it is for you;do not frighten them,
all the houses terribly tighten
upon your coming:
and they are glad
as you fill the streets of my city with children.

my love you are a bright mountain which feels.
you are a keen mountain and an eager island whose
lively slopes are based always in the me which is shrugging,which is
under you and around you and foreveni am the hugging sea.
O mountain you cannot escape me
your roots are anchored in my silence;therefore O mountain
skilfully murder my breasts,still and always

i will hug you solemnly into me.

my lady is an ivory garden,
who is filled with flowers.

under the silent and great blossom
of subtle colour which is her hair
her ear is a frail and mysterious flower
her nostrils
are timid and exquisite
flowers skilfully moving
with the least caress of breathing,her
eyes and her mouth are three flowers. My lady

is an ivory garden
her shoulders are smooth and shining
flowers
beneath which are the sharp and new
flowers of her little breasts tilting upward with love
her hand isfiveflowers
upon her whitest belly there is a clever dreamshaped flower
and her wrists are the merest most wonderful      flowersmy

And the moon is a young man

who i see regularly,about twilight,
enter the garden smiling to
himself.

which the little princes strut,taller than

stray from the others on the hill

exactly what someone has said.

Straying as softly as a puma,
it will come to Boston

With the wrinkles and eyes and tumours.)
Precisely straying like a leopard

visit queerly the naked girls who
wiggle at the end of second avenue

softly into Hassan's will see
them all dancing together,a turk

with the cousin of the old Man In The Moon playing

the kanoon.     (After that,

Raisin tight with Jack Shargel at a table in the

singing oona vaap and gesturing like a Petrouska.
And i'll gesture as well as i am able in the
transparent condition which ghosts

are afflicted with,
my gestures will be in the past tense
and bright and small and ridiculous.)
And after all i'll go to a certain

house where the window is open
i will go in between the curtains
silently,like a cat or a tune. I will find
softly and precisely a particular room where

you are perfectly asleep in your hair,
and you will kiss my ghost thinking
that it's a dream,until i leap from you

looking for something;and opened a box,and there she

The moon a noun of personal blood
Subject to that veteran verb
Of imperative vacancy

The velvet tiger of my soul
Washing in fundamental mind
Ellided chaos hating
Leases sensation absolute

Slants the huge ship of total lust
Footed with foam and clewed with stars

Lady,since your footstep
is more frail than everything
which lives,than everything which breathes
in the earth and in the sea
because your body is more new,

a dream(skilfully who mimics,entirely who pictures
yourself a skilfully and entirely moving dream
with fingers,a dream with lifted little breasts
and with feet)touches

me through the day scarcely,timidly;

whereas,beside me through the long night and upon
me,always i feel the crisply and deeply moving
you which is so glad to be alive--

the you with hot big inward stealing
thighs,perfecdy who steal me;or as the wise

sea steals entirely and skilfully the ignorant earth.

being(just a little)
too tired from kissing
for thinking or anything
except dreaming,
let us suppose

O my lady:at dusk
between the earth and the sea

ourselves,you and i together mysteriously and always floating,

moving;absorbing mysteriously(or as desire absorbs
a dream)and(as if we were dream or dreams)mysteriously
engulfed by fatal immensities of twilight--O imagine(softly as
we,our minds,mysteriously together moving float always

between the ocean and the world)that,smiling,i remark to
you:of these five waves the wave

which waits is most great;

(of these nine roses,you
reply seriously,she who chiefly hides
herself is deepest)

                                  Lady
i pray to what is unimaginable,
to your smile
which will not even allow even my pencil
nearer than a thousand miles.

i pray to your eyes
whose niceness decides my pen
it is a thick fool.

my brushes go big and stupid
and their colour(s)turns to paint before
your laughter,to which i kneel.

i worship at your tears
i approach your tears with my best chisels
(but in your least tear there is nothing
conceivable)
              my chisels stutter and wobble.

But chiefly i entreat your timidity
(i mean that aspect of you which so easily can
explore completely and enjoy the occult textures,
consult wholly and continually the invisible edges,of that and this:
distinguish swiftly and exquisitely

in all things what entirely is alive.)

              THE RAIN IS A HANDSOME ANIMAL

Whereupon i seize a train and suddenly i am in Paris toward night,in Mai.
Along the river trees are letting go scarcely and silently wisps,parcels
of incense,which drop floatingly through a vista of talking moving people;
timidly which caress hats and shoulders,wrists and dresses;which unspeak-
ingly alight upon the laughter of men and children,girls and soldiers.
In twilight these ridiculous and exquisite things descendingly move among
the people,gently and imperishably.    People are not sorry to be alive.
People are not ashamed.     People smile,moving gaily and irrevocably moving
through twilight to The Gingerbread Fair.      I am alive,I go along too,I
slowly go up the vista among the hats and soIdiers,among the smiles and
neckties,the kisses and old men,wrists and laughter. We all together ir-
revocably are moving,are moving slowly and gaily moving. Intricately the
shoulders of us and our hats timidly are touched by a million absurd hint-
ing things;by wisps and by women and by laughter and by forevenwhile,
upon our minds,fasten beautifully and close the warm tentacles of evening.

            AFTER SEEING FRENCH FUNERAL

in front of the cathedral hovered a mumbling nobody:its greenish fumbling
flesh swathed with crumbling alive rags,its trunk topped abruptly by a
slouch hat under which carefully existed the deep filthy face and out of
which sprouted wisely a decayed yellowish width of beard.

he came out just at noon:the little Place Saint Michel banged and tooted
in shallow hard sunlight;from all which upreaching through white fog the
boulevard hung,in a maze of sticky colour punched here and here at inter-
vals by black blunt shapes or where some hobgoblin trees poking sprouted
amputated hands.

millions and finally O it is spring since at all windows
microscopic birds sing fiercely two ragged men and a
filthiest woman busily are mending three wholly broken somehow
bowls or somethings by the web curb and carefully spring is
somehow skilfully everywhere mending smashed minds
O
the massacred gigantic world
again,into keen sunlight who lifts
glittering selfish new
limbs
and my heart stirs in his rags shaking from his armpits the
abundant lice of dreams laughing
rising sweetly out of the alive new mud my old
man heart striding shouts whimpers screams breathing into
his folded belly acres of sticky sunlight chatters bellows
swallowing globs of big life pricks wickedly his
mangled ears blinks into worlds of colour shrieking
O begins
          the mutilated huge earth
again,up through darkness leaping
who sprints weirdly from its deep prison
groaning with perception and suddenly in allfilthyalert things
which jumps mightily out of death
muscular,stinking,erect,entirely born.

Paris,thou art not
merely these streets trees silence
twilight,nor even this single star jotting
nothing busily upon the green edges of evening;
nor the faces which sit and drink on the boulevards,laughing
which converse smoke smile,thou art
not only a million little ladies fluttering merely upon darkness--

these things thou art and thou art all which is alert perishable
alive:thou art the sublimation of our
lives eyes voices
thou art the gesture by which we express to one another all
which we hold more dear and fragile than death,
thou art the dark dear fragile
gesture which we use

Life 's--let us not too much protest--not clumsy
more than another thing. Nor ungainly
but(after all)of a convenient size:
not too minute to die about
nor too big to lie about.

softly above everything the strolling
upward ghost of le tour Eiffel quietly wonderfully
hangs;haunting the mai.

love's absence is illusion,alias time

(a shadowy hell whose inmates war to seize
each nothing which all greedy wraiths proclaim
substance;all frenzied spectres,happiness)

lovers alone wear sunlight. The whole truth

which never was by any living death

birds meet above the new Moon
an instant:drooping,describe suddenly
arcs of craziness;chasing each
other,disappear wisely into the texture of twilight....

She is as slender as an accident
and seems to notice nothing--
perhaps
what is worthy of her comprehension
does not exist
(or else

in her mute way this portion of a circumference
understands all mysteries)

--birds crying to each other
faintly whirl and
pivot in thickening air;now is the melted moment of terror and of
dreams but the earth rising imperceptibly merging with the
lost sea bends inward and
entirely,subtly vanishes.

tonight the moon is round golden entire.   It
is satisfied and fragile,it does not
ask questions


such as "do you earn your living?    And if
not why not" or "how,under the circumstances,will
you support yourself?"      The moon is
round,not interested in
conduct
yellow
and complete.     Before proceeding
anywhere she takes care to surround her keen and
punctual circumference with an opaque
nimbus of perfectly safe colour,having
done which the moon
strides patiently along the wide quiet sky


like an intense disinterested virgin.


Who(finding herself with child)is peculiarly
careful not to lose the luminous smile which
has broken more than a handful of hearts,sent
a good many bright eyes into the dirt
hurried several big words into worms:


O poor moon
you will have a morning,
but you will be eventually slender
and noone will know unless perhaps the blind
force who laughs behind the sky.

almost by almost giving her sweet weight)

and (instant by deep instant)as her face
watches,scarcely alive,that magic Feast
greedily disappearing least by least--
through what a dizzily palpitating host

                              1.


   DEDICATED TO DEAR NANA CLARKE

       When looking at that picture, all the past
       Life of the sweet one cometh back to me;
       And with emotion deep, I think when last
       I saw her, in this world of vanity.

                             2.


     As rooms are separated by a curtain,
     So are our lives; yes, like those rooms; the first
     One is our present life; the second is
     Our life to come,--our better life in Heaven;
     The separating curtain,--it is death.

                       OUR FLAG

O flag of the nation! O Red,White and Blue!
O symbol of liberty,waving anew!
All through our lives may we reverence thee,
The nation's bright ensign for liberty!

Dear flag,thou art sacred in peace and in war,
Where many have died for the stripe and the star,
Where many have died that the slave may be free,
Have died for the nation and liberty!

Thou has seen the great battles,thou hast witnessed the strife
And the din of the conflicts,death struggling with life,
And thy bright,waving banner,the dying could see
Who had fought for the nation and liberty.

So whenever we meet thee,it matters not where;
Be thou waving at home or on battlement bare,
May we stop and salute thee,whenever we see
The nation's bright banner for liberty.

                     GOD

Great, good, just, kind and loving God,
Oh! tell us how we can ever
Thank Thee enough for what Thou hast done!
For the bond that none can sever,
That binds us mortals close to Thee,
And gives us wisdom and eyes to see.

For it is Thou who gives us strength
To try to be like Thee.
And working, pushing toward the goal
Of purity;
We let our better nature shine
Illumined by Thy light divine.

                             T H E RIVER OF M I S T


   Stretching away to westward the great river lies quiet beneath me.
So still it lies, that it seems as if it had not yet awakened from the
delicious sleep brought on by the silence of night.         A little distance
from the shore a boat is moored on its glassy surface,--perfect to every
detail the reflection glimmers below it.      All is still and sombre and
wonderful, as dawn gives way to daylight and night to morning.
   As I stand leaning over the rail of the old wooden bridge that spans
it, I give full play to my imagination, and gaze ahead into the morning
fog that rests above its polished surface.      And as I gaze, gaze into
the deep white mist, my thoughts turn from earth to heaven, from mankind
to my God.       Far away, beyond the limits of that stream that fades into
the atmosphere, I can see a great celestial river and a great celestial
land.    Ah!    How my fancy pictures it,--how vivid and how real it seems!
How plainly I can see the inestimable future!         And how I doubly worship
the Great Power that has created all this.       How wonderful and how mar-
vellous it all is!   How sweet is this unconscious dreaming of the soul!
   A slight sound from the waking city brings me back to ugly reality.
I turn my head backward.         In an instant, all the beauteous castles of
the future which my imagination so vividly builded, vanish from my mind.
All is gone!     Gone in a moment!        And nothing is left me but this world
as I turn away from the wonderful river of mist.

B.FROM THE CAMBRIDGE LATIN SCHOOL YEARS, 1908-n


                              1.


         The world is very big, and we
         Are very small and ignorant,
         But, till our Father doth transplant,
         Into the garden we forsee--
         Fragrant upon a far off lee--
         Each frail and quickly withered plant,
         He doth to each a duty grant,
         And He hath given one to me!

         To all the work that doth relate
         To aiding these my fellow men,
         To peace, to nation, and to state,
         To noblest thought & impulse, when
         The impulse comes--I dedicate
         This heart, this soul, this mind, this pen!

                           2.


A chilly,murky night;
The street lamps flicker low,
A hail-like,whispering rain
Beats 'gainst the streaked,bleak pane;
The sickly,ghostly glow
Of the blurred,blinking,wavering,flickering light
Shines on the muddy streets in sombre gleams
Like a wierd lamp post on a road of dreams.

A dreary,heavy darkness;
In quivering folds it creeps
Over the shrouded world;
The leaves are dry and curl'd,
The soul of summer sleeps
In a black pall where all the world lies markless,--
And shrouded 'neath that form whose clammy breath
Chills as it clasps,he sleeps the sleep of death.

Night,thou canst not dismay!
For when,on life's dark eve,
Like flowers past their bloom,
We tenant that grim tomb,
And all behind us leave,
Know that from its cold clutch into the Day
We walk,preserved,uninjured;--comprehend
No fear,no hell,no misery,no End!

         THE PASSING OF THE YEAR

The world outside is dark; my fire burns low;
All's quiet, save the ticking of the clock
And rusding of the ruddy coals, that flock
Together, hot and red, to gleam and glow.
The sad old year is near his overthrow,
And all the world is waiting for the shock
That frees the new year from his dungeon lock.--
So the tense earth lies waiting in her snow.

Old year, I grieve that we should part so soon,--
The coals burn dully in the wavering light;
All sounds of joy to me seem out of tune,--
The tying embers creep from red to white,
They die. Clocks strike. Up leaps the great, glad moon!
Out peal the bells! Old year,--dear year,--good night!

EARLY SUMMER SKETCH

     The rain
     Drips down
     O'er fields
     All green
     With grain.

     Earth's gown
     Is seen
     Clinging
     To her
     In folds
     Bedraggled.

     The grey
     Sky yields
     Great drops
     Down-winging
     O'er tops
     Of fir
     And wolds
     Green-gay
     With Summer,
     The new-comer.

     For sod
     Has haggled
     With sky.

     The tears
     Fall fast
     On high.

     Aghast
     And Dazed
     Earth stands,
     And lifts
     Her hands,
     To see
     The wrong
     Which she
     Has done.

The sun
Breaks out
And sears
The drifts
Of cloud
That float
Along.

The shroud
No longer
Low-lies.

The note
Of the song
Of the bird
Is heard.

The cloud
Is furled.

Earth cries
A shout
Of gladness.

O'er skies,
And trees,
And leaf,
And leas
Of bay
Breaks day.

                SUMMER SONG

                           I

   Warm air throbbing with locust songs,
   Warm clouds screening the heavens' blue rifts.
Warm sun shadowing over-head cloud drifts,
Warm sky straining, earth-tethered, at her cloud-thongs.

                           II

                     Far away
                A thrushes' choir trills.
                     Far away
           The murmur of a river's rills,
            Drumming of the thunder fist,
            Coming of the rain mist,--
                     Peeping,
                     Creeping,
                     Leaping,
                     Sweeping
                 O'er the weeping
                     Hot hills.

                      6.

                      IF

If freckles were lovely, and day was night,
And measles were nice and a lie warn't a lie,
       Life would be delight,--
       But things couldn't go right
       For in such a sad plight
/ wouldn't be /.

If earth was heaven, and now was hence,
And past was present, and false was true,
       There might be some sense
       But I'd be in suspense
       For on such a pretense
You wouldn't be you.

If fear was plucky, and globes were square,
And dirt was cleanly and tears were glee
       Things would seem fair,--
       Yet they'd all despair,
       For if here was there
We wouldn't be we.

                 THE EAGLE




It was one of those clear,sharp,mistless days
     That summer and man delight in.
Never had Heaven seemed quite so high,
Never had earth seemed quite so green,
Never had world seemed quite so clean
     Or sky so nigh.
     And I heard the Deity's voice in
       The sun's warm rays,
     And the white cloud's intricate maze,
And the blue sky's beautiful sheen.


                          2


I looked to the heavens and saw him there,--
     A black speck downward drifting.
Nearer and nearer he steadily sailed,
Nearer and nearer he slid through space,
In an unending aerial race,
     This sailor who hailed
     From the Clime of the Clouds.--Ever shifting,
       On billows of air.
     And the blue sky seemed never so fair;
And the rest of the world kept pace.


                          3

On the white of his head the sun flashed bright;
     And he battled the wind with wide pinions,
Clearer and clearer the gale whistled loud,
Clearer and clearer he came into view,--
Bigger and blacker against the blue.
     Then a dragon of cloud
     Gathering all its minions
       Rushed to the fight,
     And swallowed him up at a bite;
And the sky lay empty clear through.

                                   4

        Long I watched. And at last afar
             Caught sight of a speck in the vastness;
        Ever smaller,ever decreasing,
        Ever drifting,drifting away
        Into the endless realms of day;
             Finally ceasing.
             So into Heaven's vast fastness
               Vanished that bar
        Of black,as a fluttering star
        Goes out while still on its way.


                                   5

        So I lost him. But I shall always see
             In my mind
        The warm,yellow sun,and the ether free;
        The vista'd sky,and the white cloud trailing,
             Trailing behind.--
        And below the young earth's summer-green arbors,
        And on high the eagle,--sailing,sailing
             Into far skies and unknown harbors.

       THE BOY AND THE MAN

Once upon a time
                A boy looked to the sky
                Where big white clouds lay furled,
                And he muttered with a sigh,
                "0,would I were a man!--
                How commonplace this world!
                Would I could roam and roam,
                Where all is strange and new,
                Where there are deeds to do,
                And find a grand,new home
                Where new folks came and went"--
                Thus did the boy lament,
                Ending as he began,--
                "O,would I were a man!"

Once upon a time
                A man looked to the sky

                And he cried with a sigh,
                "0,would I were a boy!--
                How dear was that old world,
                With the dear ones ever close,
                Afar from strange,new places
                Full of unknown,staring faces,
                Unfeeling,and morose.
                Give me my home,God-sent!"
                Thus did the man lament,
                Groaning,"Gone boyhood's joy!
                0,would I were a boy!"

God,Thine the hand that doth extend
    The booby prize of failure,and
The victor's chaplet in the end.
    God,Thine the hand.

God,mine the power to die or live,
    To find the earth-fruit sweet or sour,
To take and keep,or take and give.
    God,mine the power.

God,keep me trying to win the prize;
    Pamper me not,though I be crying.
Though snickering worlds wink owlish eyes,
    God,keep me trying.

                     MY PRAYER

   God make me the poet of simplicity,
   Force,and clearness. Help me to live
Ever up to ever higher standards. Teach me to lay
   A strong,simple,big-rocked wall
   Firmly,the first of all,
And to fill in the fissures with the finer stones and clay
   Of alliteration,simile,metaphor.     Give
   Power to point out error in sorrow and in felicity.
Make me a truthful poet,ever true to the voice of my
                       Call,
   Groping about in the blackest night
   For ever clearer,dearer light,
Sturdily standing firm and undismayed on a Pillar of
                      Right,
   Working with heart,and soul,and a willing might,
Writing my highest Ideal large in whatsoever I write,
   Truthfully,loftily,chivalrously,and cheerfully ever,
                     Fearfully ,never.

On souls robbed of their birth-right's better part,
Born only in one world, through life to see
This nether sphere alone--God's pity be;
Poor, purblind purchasers at life's high mart.
The Great Physician, lest the ravaged heart
Reveal itself in anguish, did decree
The Lord of Sense, Contempt, that he set free
The mangled spirit from its memory-smart.
So, deep in scorn for him of perfect sight,
The blinded soul remembereth not her scars.

      But who hath sudden felt his spirit beat,
Sped through the smoking dark with fear-shod feet,
Still hounded, haunted, hunted down the night
By all the crying beauty of the stars?

              DEATH'S CHIMNEY

Within,a coldly echoing floona terror
Of narrow,naked walls,whitened and ghastly,
Through whose grim hollowness,faint and incessant,
Is heard a murmuring horror of fires communing.
What flesh and blood,what hands and face,what beauty
Shrivels beneath the touch of flames caressing--
Becomes obliterate in this awful furnace?
What life dwelt in this formless heap of ashes
Drawn forth,--the fires subdued,the furnace opened,--
To inhabit yon dead vault of icy marble,
Under the day,dwelling in its own darkness,
Under the world,shrouded in its own silence?
What eye shall read this shadowy inscription?
What hand upon this cold thing lay its cypress?
What lip shall touch the silent vase of ashes?
The body,the human body divine,burning.

Without,warm flood of universal sunshine;
And a white butterfly,hovering,soaring,ascending...

               AFTER-GLOW

        Blue water, and behind,
        Benevolent orange sky,
        And gende sheep that troop
        From their huge fields of cloud,
        Hurrying, headed all
        Homeward across the heaven,
        Unto the western folds,
        Where stands upon a hill,
        Calling with gentle voice,
        One cheery shepherd-star.

        Stand still, O Shepherd! I,
        With many other feet
        And many, many flocks
        From all the purple earth,
        And all the yellow heaven,
        Am coming, hurrying home,
        Lifting mine eyes to thee,
        And listening for thy call
        Across the fragrant fields,
        Adown the quiet world.

        Grey water, yellow sky;
        Alas! my star is gone,--
        Departed, over the hill.
        And all the flocks that heard
        Their shepherd's call, and I,
        Pause, midway in the rich
        And honeyed middle heaven,
        Sniffing the luscious sweet;--
        No star, no shepherd.     Shall
        We lag in the middle way?

        No.   On, ye flocks! And I,
        Who heard his call, and saw
        His tender, starry face,--
        Down the soft, padded mead,
        O'er fair, alluring fields,
        Along ambrosial lands,
        Away into the sun,
        Will follow, follow him,
        And farther, farther on,
        And up, up, over the hill!

Farewell,runaway snows! For the meadow is green,and the tree stands
 Clad in her beautiful hair.
New life leavens the land! The river,once where the lea stands,
 Hideth and huggeth his lair.
Beautywith shining limbs 'mid the Graces comes forth,and in glee stands,
  Ringed with the rythmical fair.

Hope not,mortal,to live forever,the year whispers lowly.
  Hope not,time murmurs,and flies.
Soft is the frozen sod to the Zephyr's sandal,as wholly
  Summer drives Spring from the skies,--
Dying when earth receives the fruits of Autumn,till slowly
  Forth Winter creeps,and she dies.

Yet what escapes from heaven,the fleet moons capture,retrieving;
  When through Death's dream we survey
Heroes and kings of old,in lands of infinite grieving,
  What are we? Shadow and clay.
Say will rulers above us the fate tomorrow is weaving
  Add to the sum of today?

Hear me:whatever thou giv'st to thine own dear soul,shall not pleasure
  Hungering fingers of kin.
Once in the gloom,when the judge of Shades in pitiless measure
  Dooms thee to journey within,
Birth,nor eloquent speech,nor gift of piety's treasure
  Opens the portal of sin.

Never,goddess of chasteness,from night infernal thou freest
  One who for chastity fell.
Ever,hero of Athens,him who loved thee thou seest
  Writhe in the chainings of Hell.

                  BOOK I, ODE 4

The fetters of winter are shattered,shattered,
And the limbs of the earth are free,--
Spring,and the breeze that loveth the lea!
And the old keels--gaping and tempest battered--
Men roll them down to the sea.

Lo,how the sweet new magic bewitcheth
The hind with his fire-side dream;
The ox in his byre stamps with desire;
No more on the meadows the white rime pitcheth
His tents of a wintry gleam.

The Graces are dancing by mountains and gorges,
Like blossoms white in the moon;
Love is their light through the spell-bound night.
Under the world in Hell's huge forges
Hammers gigantic croon.

Open thy door;death knocks,who careth
For palace and hut the same.
Why wilt thou plan with life but a span?
All feel the hand that never spareth,
The fingers that know not fame.

Tomorrow--who knows?--in her train may bring thee
The city of dim renown.
There is nought redeems from the House of Dreams--
Ne'er again shall the kind dice king thee,
Never be Pleasure thy crown.

Ah, Postumus, fleet-footed are the years!
   And what is Piety's imploring glance
To Age and Death, the dauntless charioteers?


My friend, think not to buy deliverance
   With smoking centuries of hecatombs.
It shall not profit thine inheritance.


King of the City of Unnumbered Homes,
   Who doth the monster and the brute compel,
Where the blind darkness ever gropes and roams,


By that black, languorous stream that winds in Hell,
   Whereon the noble and the knave must face
A common passage--wither, who can tell!--


Great Pluto, Postumus, implores thy grace!....
   Silence....Didst think those eyes, which are two stars,
Would suffer for thy sake one tear's embrace?


Although thou locked thy portals unto Mars,
   Nor e'er bestrode,--uncurbed by bit or rein,
Old Hadria's white horses,--'scaped the scars


Of the sword-edged sirocco, 'tis in vain.
   Fate bids that journey to Cocytus' stream,
And Danaus' ill-famed race behold again,


And Sisyphus, damned unto toil supreme.
   Fate sunders wife and husband, wedded brass
And miser; all and each, as in a dream.


How treacherous the treasures we amass!
   One only hath remembrance of our care,
The hated cypress-tree.     And so we pass.


Riving an hundred locks, and laying bare
   In its ripe age rich Caecuban divine,
Purer than pontiffs quaff, a lordlier heir
   Shall paint the pavement with thy titled wine!

Who chides the tears that weep so dear a head?
Sorrowful Muse,for whom the father wed
The voice of waters to a cithern string,
Teach thou my grief to sing.

Ye sisters,Right and Honor,and forsooth
Unshaken Loyalty,and naked Truth,
Quintillius the peerless ye shall weep,
Who sleeps unending sleep.

Vainly,poor Virgil,rise thy pious prayers
To heaven which took him from thee unawares;
His memory many a noble friend reveres,
Thine were the bitterest tears.

What tho' more sweet thy lyre than his of Thrace,
When listening trees joyed in the music's grace,
Would life reclaim the shade from the beyond,
WTiich,with his fearsome wand,

The Shepherd,harsh the doors of fate to keep,
Has gathered once unto his shadowy sheep?
'Tis hard:but when 'twere impious to rebel,
Less grows the load borne well.

               (An Invocation to Apollo)


0,blessed of the gods,
Shield of the race of Rome,
Are Faith and Fame at odds?
Thy smile is Spring.--0,too long thou dost roam,
     From home.


As a fond mother stands,
Seeking with prayerful eyes
O'er sea and sinuous sands
Her long-departed son,for whom black skies
     Arise.


So doth this land of ours
Yearn for her mighty son;
All lapped in fruit and flow'rs,
While on her waves the pinioned vessels run,
     Nor shun


The pirate or his kin.
The hearths of faith are pure,
And tamed is spotted sin.
With Caesar safe/where shall the savage boor
     Endure?


The mother loves to trace
In baby eyes and brow
Gleams of the father's face.
What's war with Spain?     WTio fears the Scythian now?
     0,thou,


Upon thy Roman hills
Salute the drowsy light,
And lead the vine,that fills
Thy bowls,to the chaste tree in wedlock rite.
     Requite

The Gods with prayer and wine,
And as her heroes-Greece,
So,Roman,rank divine
Thy Caesar,with a joy which shall increase,
    Nor cease.



To thee the poet drinks--
"Long life!"--ere day is done;
"Peace to thy land!"--when sinks
Under the ocean,mellow eve begun,
    The sun.
